absolutely O
amazing O

10 O
plus O
hours O
of O
battery O
... O

super O
fast O
processor O

really O
nice O
graphics O
card.. O

and O
plenty O

250 O
gb O
( O
though O

ram.. O
) O

computer O
is O
really O

i O
'm O
shocked O
as O

how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
get O
used O
to O
... O

i O
've O
only O
had O

day O
but O
i O
'm O
already O

macs O
are O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O

get O
this O
computer O
for O
portability O
and O
fast O
processing O
! O
! O
! O

the O
laptop O
was O
really O
good O
and O
it O
goes O
really O
fast O
just O
the O
way O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
of O
run O
. O

i O
would O
really O
recommend O
to O
any O
person O
out O
there O
to O
get O
this O
laptop O
cause O
its O
really O
worth O
it O
. O

and O
its O
really O
cheap O
and O
you O
wont O
regret O
buying O
it O
. O

as O
a O
lifelong O
windows O
user O
, O
i O
was O
extremely O
pleased O
to O
make O
the O
change O
to O
mac O
. O

as O
a O
computer O
science O
student O
in O
college O
, O
i O
find O
that O
the O
portability O
, O
longevity O
, O
and O
ease O
of O
use O
of O
this O
computer O
make O
me O
( O
shockingly O
) O
want O
to O
do O
homework O
more O
; O

without O
a O
big O
ol O
' O
clunky O
machine O
in O
my O
backpack O
, O
i O
feel O
like O
i O
can O
do O
programming O
homework O
anywhere O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
computer O
for O
students O
looking O
for O
a O
solid O
machine O
to O
get O
them O
through O
college O
. O

a O
great O
feature O
is O
the O
spotlight O
search O
: O
one O
can O
search O
for O
documents O
by O
simply O
typing O
a O
keyword O
, O
rather O
than O
parsing O
tens O
of O
file O
folders O
for O
a O
document O
. O

oh O
my O
goodness-i O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
. O

my O
hp O
is O
very O
heavy O
. O

not O
easy O
to O
carry O
. O

the O
battery O
has O
never O
worked O
well O
. O

the O
battery O
gets O
so O
hot O
it O
is O
scary O
. O

yet O
, O
hp O
wo O
n't O
do O
anything O
about O
the O
problem O
. O

i O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
hp O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
. O

when O
i O
got O
the O
computer O
back O
and O
realizwed O
it O
still O
was O
not O
correct O
hp O
told O
me O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty O
and O
now O
it O
was O
my O
problem O
. O

so O
, O
you O
can O
imagine O
how O
unhappy O
i O
am O
with O
this O
item O
. O

currently O
if O
i O
use O
the O
laptop O
i O
ca O
n't O
sit O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
because O
it O
will O
burn O
my O
legs O
. O

i O
did O
contact O
hp O
and O
share O
how O
unhappy O
i O
am O
. O

well O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
a O
bunch O
. O

but O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
they O
( O
the O
company O
) O
would O
not O
and O
could O
not O
do O
anything O
about O
my O
problem O
. O

i O
would O
say O
if O
you O
want O
to O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
machines O
be O
careful O
. O

and O
, O
if O
you O
are O
going O
to O
deal O
with O
hp O
be O
careful O
. O

in O
my O
house O
, O
hp O
is O
a O
nasty O
word O
. O

since O
i O
purchased O
my O
toshiba O
netbook O
, O
i O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
, O
i O
have O
a O
laptob O
and O
a O
desktop O
. O

the O
netbook O
is O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
take O
to O
bed O
and O
carry O
around O
with O
me O
. O

the O
screen O
takes O
some O
getting O
use O
to O
, O
because O
it O
is O
smaller O
than O
the O
laptop O
. O

i O
have O
not O
have O
any O
problems O
. O

the O
notebook O
pc O
, O
toshiba O
qosmio O
is O
the O
best O
gift O
my O
father O
could O
have O
ever O
gotten O
me O
. O

he O
gave O
me O
this O
pc O
about O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
up O
to O
this O
point O
im O
still O
sitting O
here O
using O
it O
. O

its O
still O
going O
. O

it O
is O
in O
the O
best O
condition O
and O
has O
a O
really O
high O
quality O
. O

this O
is O
something O
i O
would O
deffinately O
reccomend O
to O
someone O
. O

you O
will O
not O
regret O
buying O
such O
a O
great O
thing O
like O
this O
! O

it O
ca O
n't O
get O
any O
better O
. O

waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

ease O
of O
use O
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
i O
love O
about O
my O
mac O
. O

this O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O
and O
windows O
7 O
is O
great O
! O

it O
's O
fast O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
easy O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
easy O
to O
hook O
to O
my O
wireless O
network O
. O

it O
's O
even O
easy O
to O
hook O
up O
to O
other O
wireless O
networks O
. O

the O
battery O
does O
n't O
last O
long O
but O
i O
'm O
sure O
an O
upgrade O
battery O
would O
solve O
that O
problem O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
laptop O
in O
a O
way O
though O
that O
needs O
a O
long O
battery O
life O
so O
it O
's O
perfect O
for O
me O
. O

most O
everything O
is O
fine O
with O
this O
machine O
: O
speed O
, O
capacity O
, O
build O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
do O
n't O
understand O
is O
that O
the O
resolution O
of O
the O
screen O
is O
n't O
high O
enough O
for O
some O
pages O
, O
such O
as O
yahoo O
! O
mail O
. O

yes O
, O
i O
have O
it O
on O
the O
highest O
available O
setting O
. O

i O
bought O
it O
for O
really O
cheap O
also O
and O
it O
's O
amazing O
. O

easy O
to O
start O
up O
and O
does O
not O
overheat O
as O
much O
as O
other O
laptops O
. O

recommended O
to O
people O
as O
their O
first O
laptop O
. O

plain O
and O
simple O
, O
it O
( O
laptop O
) O
runs O
great O
and O
loads O
fast O
. O

easy O
to O
carry O
, O
can O
be O
taken O
anywhere O
, O
can O
be O
hooked O
up O
to O
printers O
, O
headsets O
. O

love O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
space O
like O
a O
regular O
computer O
. O

i O
'm O
already O
hooked O
on O
the O
sleek O
look O
and O
dependability O
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
shown O
. O

being O
a O
pc O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
, O
it O
's O
taking O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
os O
of O
a O
mac O
but O
i O
'm O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
. O

the O
unibody O
design O
is O
edgy O
and O
durable O
. O

the O
led O
backlit O
display O
makes O
my O
pictures O
pop O
so O
much O
more O
. O

i O
'm O
learning O
the O
finger O
options O
for O
the O
mousepad O
that O
allow O
for O
quicker O
browsing O
of O
web O
pages O
. O

granted O
, O
it O
's O
still O
a O
very O
new O
laptop O
but O
in O
comparison O
to O
my O
previous O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
, O
my O
mac O
boots O
up O
noticeably O
quicker O
. O

a O
key O
contributor O
that O
led O
me O
to O
mac O
is O
the O
art O
aspect O
. O

they O
have O
developed O
excellent O
proprietary O
software O
for O
editing O
video O
and O
pictures O
and O
i O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
utilizing O
these O
tools O
on O
the O
regular O
. O

i O
'm O
excited O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
what O
this O
powerful O
machine O
has O
to O
offer O
and O
encourage O
others O
to O
do O
the O
same O
. O

it O
's O
more O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
it O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

great O
product O
, O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
great O
graphics O
. O

one O
drawback O
, O
i O
wish O
the O
keys O
were O
backlit O
. O

i O
'm O
glad O
i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
, O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
few O
( O
$ O
100 O
) O
extra O
dollars O
. O

it O
had O
most O
of O
the O
features O
and O
all O
of O
the O
power O
that O
i O
wanted O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
machine O
. O

i O
was O
n't O
really O
as O
concerned O
about O
portability O
( O
it O
's O
a O
very O
large O
laptop O
) O
but O
it O
's O
not O
hard O
to O
move O
around O
or O
take O
on O
a O
trip O
which O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

i O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
machine O
! O

i O
love O
the O
size O
, O
keyboard O
, O
the O
functions O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
really O
have O
a O
complaint O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
good O
quality O
and O
good O
price O
. O

perfect O
trifecta O
! O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

the O
salesman O
talked O
us O
into O
this O
computer O
away O
from O
another O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
and O
we O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
with O
software O
problems O
and O
just O
not O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

this O
is O
my O
first O
dell O
i O
heard O
their O
customer O
service O
was O
lacking O
and O
that O
they O
were O
working O
on O
improving O
it O
! O

i O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
9 O
months O
ago O
! O

the O
dvd O
burner O
broke O
after O
burning O
3 O
dvd O
'd O
during O
that O
time O
! O

they O
sent O
me O
a O
replacement O
part O
and O
without O
informing O
me O
are O
requiring O
that O
i O
return O
it O
within O
15 O
days O
or O
contact O
them O
and O
let O
them O
know O
the O
broken O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
later O
. O

i O
am O
currently O
out O
of O
town O
and O
called O
to O
inform O
them O
the O
broken O
part O
would O
be O
returned O
when O
i O
got O
back O
in O
town O
. O

if O
this O
is O
an O
improvement O
in O
customer O
service O
then O
i O
would O
hate O
too O
see O
what O
it O
was O
before O
! O

i O
spoke O
to O
4 O
different O
people O
and O
was O
told O
they O
needed O
to O
transfer O
me O
to O
a O
5th O
person O
! O

needless O
to O
say O
i O
told O
them O
no O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
day O
and O
hung O
up O
! O

i O
can O
guarantee O
this O
will O
be O
the O
last O
dell O
i O
will O
ever O
purchase O
! O

breaking O
within O
1 O
year O
of O
purchase O
and O
speaking O
to O
4+ O
people O
to O
report O
the O
damaged O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
late O
! O

i O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
company O
or O
their O
products O
! O
! O
! O
! O

so O
far O
, O
a O
great O
product O
. O

high O
price O
tag O
, O
however O
. O

still O
trying O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
it O
. O

it O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
dell O
ever O
made O
. O

it O
is O
hard O
to O
fix O
and O
makes O
it O
a O
hassle O
to O
own O
one O
. O

breaks O
easily O
. O

only O
good O
thing O
is O
the O
graphics O
quality O
. O

there O
are O
so O
many O
wonderful O
features O
and O
benefits O
to O
the O
new O
macbook O
! O

the O
# O
1 O
reason O
that O
is O
always O
repeated O
. O

no O
viruses O
! O

this O
laptop O
is O
fast O
and O
you O
will O
literally O
learn O
all O
you O
can O
do O
with O
this O
dynamo O
by O
just O
watching O
the O
online O
tutorials O
. O

i O
am O
loyal O
to O
apple O
. O

the O
macbooks O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

they O
're O
easy O
, O
fun O
, O
powerful O
and O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

the O
great O
18 O
month O
same O
as O
cash O
financing O
and O
advance O
protection O
plan O
which O
includes O
accidents O
like O
spills O
. O
, O
which O
apple O
does O
n't O
offer O
, O
is O
why O
i O
bought O
my O
macbook O
at O
best O
buy O
. O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
! O

this O
just O
keeps O
having O
it O
's O
hard O
drive O
replaced O
! O

acer O
wo O
n't O
replace O
the O
laptop O
. O

the O
manufacturer O
's O
warranty O
only O
covers O
replacement O
/ O
repair O
of O
parts O
. O

this O
thing O
is O
a O
lemon O
. O

this O
macbook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value O
. O

its O
ease O
of O
use O
and O
the O
top O
service O
from O
apple- O
be O
it O
their O
phone O
assistance O
or O
bellying O
up O
to O
the O
genius O
bar- O
can O
not O
be O
beat O
. O

suffice O
it O
to O
say O
, O
my O
macbook O
pro O
keeps O
me O
going O
with O
its O
long O
battery O
life O
and O
blazing O
speed O
. O

it O
does O
run O
a O
little O
warm O
but O
that O
is O
a O
negligible O
concern O
. O

i O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
receive O
the O
toshiba O
l455 O
as O
a O
gift/bonus O
for O
some O
work O
i O
had O
done O
for O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
! O

i O
have O
owned O
it O
only O
two O
months O
! O

i O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
since O
the O
day O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
! O

my O
first O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
pre-loaded O
norton O
firewall O
/ O
security O
program O
. O

it O
would O
not O
let O
me O
connect O
to O
my O
wifi O
system O
where O
i O
lived O
. O

it O
took O
toshiba O
tech O
support O
4 O
calls O
and O
4 O
different O
techs O
to O
correct O
the O
problem O
. O

then O
just O
the O
other O
day O
, O
my O
left O
`` O
mouse O
'' O
button O
snapped O
! O

being O
only O
2 O
months O
old O
, O
i O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
! O

buyer O
beware O
. O

this O
one O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
might O
be O
a O
lemon O
! O

it O
rarely O
works O
and O
when O
it O
does O
it O
's O
incredibly O
slow O
. O

i O
have O
had O
to O
take O
it O
to O
the O
geek O
squad O
guys O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
because O
it O
has O
had O
viruses O
3 O
times O
and O
i O
have O
not O
even O
had O
it O
for O
more O
then O
4 O
months O
! O

*if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
laptop O
, O
this O
is O
not O
it O
! O

like O
the O
price O
and O
operation O
. O

some O
features O
arent O
friendly O
( O
volume O
wheel O
, O
sound O
quality O
, O
etc O
. O

but O
, O
for O
the O
cost O
this O
is O
a O
winner O
. O

i O
absolutely O
love O
my O
mac O
! O

i O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
my O
life O
without O
it O
anymore O
! O

it O
's O
perfect O
for O
everything O
and O
runs O
faster O
than O
an O
average O
pc O
! O

i O
've O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
major O
problems O
with O
the O
laptop O
except O
that O
the O
plastic O
piece O
that O
covers O
the O
usb O
port O
wires O
have O
all O
come O
off O
. O

apparently O
they O
are O
defective O
since O
they O
are O
not O
securely O
attached O
. O

i O
can O
barely O
use O
any O
usb O
devices O
because O
they O
will O
not O
stay O
connected O
properly O
. O

i O
called O
toshiba O
and O
they O
want O
me O
to O
be O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
while O
they O
look O
at O
the O
problem O
. O

i O
think O
i O
might O
rather O
suffer O
for O
something O
that O
is O
simple O
to O
fix O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
was O
the O
worst O
laptop O
i O
've O
ever O
bought O
. O

i O
spent O
alot O
of O
money O
on O
this O
product O
and O
its O
been O
a O
nightmare O
. O

and O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
company O
has O
been O
a O
even O
worse O
nightmare O
. O

i O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
fix O
in O
perfect O
condition O
but O
for O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
. O

they O
sent O
it O
back O
with O
a O
huge O
crack O
in O
it O
and O
it O
still O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

and O
that O
was O
the O
fourth O
time O
ive O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
get O
fixed O
. O

its O
been O
a O
year O
and O
am O
still O
waiting O
to O
see O
what O
there O
going O
to O
do O
about O
my O
laptop O
. O

so O
if O
anyones O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
computer O
or O
laptop O
you O
should O
stay O
far O
far O
away O
from O
any O
that O
have O
the O
name O
toshiba O
on O
it O
... O

i O
saved O
for O
this O
laptop O
for O
3 O
months O
and O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
personally O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

the O
display O
on O
this O
computer O
is O
the O
best O
i O
've O
seen O
in O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
very O
long O
and O
very O
convienent O
. O

a O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
is O
well O
, O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

i O
've O
been O
a O
pc O
user O
and O
i O
just O
finally O
switched O
and O
i O
am O
never O
going O
back O
. O

it O
is O
amazing O
. O

in O
the O
first O
moth O
of O
owning O
this O
computer O
its O
hardrive O
failed O
which O
had O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

after O
replacing O
the O
hard O
drive O
the O
battery O
stopped O
working O
( O
3 O
months O
of O
use O
) O
which O
was O
frustrating O
. O

then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger O
stopped O
working O
so O
i O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware O
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

a O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O
computer O
: O
do O
not O
buy O
it O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
last O
. O

has O
a O
5-6 O
hour O
battery O
life O
. O

much O
faster O
than O
my O
old O
windows O
laptop O
that O
died O
on O
me O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
lightweight O
. O

was O
very O
much O
worth O
the O
price O
i O
paid O
. O

this O
netbook O
went O
bad O
on O
me O
after O
3 O
days O
. O

there O
is O
a O
blank O
lighted O
screen O
when O
i O
start O
and O
that O
is O
all O
. O

i O
am O
also O
upset O
with O
cr O
for O
giving O
a O
good O
rating O
. O

i O
purchased O
this O
netbook O
after O
my O
original O
toshiba O
laptop O
crashed O
right O
after O
the O
warranty O
expired O
. O

three O
weeks O
after O
i O
bought O
the O
netbook O
, O
the O
screen O
quit O
working O
. O

i O
baby O
my O
electronics O
so O
i O
know O
for O
a O
fact O
it O
was O
defective O
and O
not O
anything O
that O
i O
did O
to O
it O
. O

overall O
i O
feel O
this O
netbook O
was O
poor O
quality O
, O
had O
poor O
performance O
, O
although O
it O
did O
have O
great O
battery O
life O
when O
it O
did O
work O
. O

took O
the O
netbook O
on O
a O
vacation O
trip O
and O
i O
was O
able O
to O
do O
whatever O
i O
wanted O
to O
do O
without O
lugging O
a O
much O
heavier O
laptop O
. O

to O
my O
mind O
much O
more O
usable O
than O
the O
toy O
called O
an O
ipad O
. O

the O
so O
called O
laptop O
runs O
to O
slow O
and O
i O
hate O
it O
! O

do O
not O
buy O
it O
! O

it O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
ever O

the O
image O
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
soud O
is O
excelent O
. O

i O
love O
ths O
notebook O
. O

i O
love O
the O
glass O
touchpad O
. O

easy O
learning O
curve O
. O

also O
the O
display O
is O
exceptional O
! O

i O
have O
loved O
this O
since O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

the O
battery O
is O
really O
long O
. O

the O
features O
are O
great O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
it O
needs O
is O
better O
speakers O
. O

small O
and O
light O
weight O
. O

speakers O
too O
small O
to O
be O
of O
any O
real O
use O
. O

keyboard O
good O
sized O
and O
wasy O
to O
use O
. O

i O
like O
it O
! O

meets O
my O
needs O
perfectly O
and O
is O
light O
enough O
for O
this O
senior O
to O
carry O
without O
affecting O
my O
arthritis O
. O

needless O
to O
say O
, O
not O
to O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
! O

the O
design O
is O
awesome O
, O
quality O
is O
unprecedented O
. O

apparently O
well-built O
and O
gorgeous O
to O
look O
at O
, O
the O
i5 O
macbook O
pro O
is O
a O
winning O
combination O
of O
price O
and O
performance O
. O

it O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
investments O
i O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

consumer O
report O
recommended O
toshiba O
. O

am O
very O
glad O
i O
bought O
it O
, O
great O
netbook O
, O
low O
price O
. O

very O
good O
quality O
and O
well O
made O
. O

great O
pick O
for O
portability O
and O
affordability O
. O

the O
black O
model O
also O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
seamless O
appearance O
- O
one O
of O
the O
better O
looking O
notebooks O
i O
've O
seen O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
screen O
resolutions O
! O

if O
you O
need O
an O
affordable O
, O
entry-level O
laptop O
, O
this O
will O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O

i O
dislike O
the O
weight O
and O
size O
, O
cubersome O
. O
