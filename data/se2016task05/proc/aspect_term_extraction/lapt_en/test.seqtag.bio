absolutely O
amazing O

10 O
plus O
hours O
of O
battery O
... O

super O
fast O
processor O

really O
nice O
graphics O
card.. O

and O
plenty O

250 O
gb O
( O
though O

ram.. O
) O

computer O
is O
really O

i O
'm O
shocked O
as O

how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
get O
used O
to O
... O

i O
've O
only O
had O

day O
but O
i O
'm O
already O

macs O
are O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O

get O
this O
computer O
for O
portability O
and O
fast O
processing O
! O
! O
! O

the O
laptop O
was O
really O
good O
and O
it O
goes O
really O
fast O
just O
the O
way O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
of O
run O
. O

i O
would O
really O
recommend O
to O
any O
person O
out O
there O
to O
get O
this O
laptop O
cause O
its O
really O
worth O
it O
. O

and O
its O
really O
cheap O
and O
you O
wont O
regret O
buying O
it O
. O

as O
a O
lifelong O
windows O
user O
, O
i O
was O
extremely O
pleased O
to O
make O
the O
change O
to O
mac O
. O

as O
a O
computer O
science O
student O
in O
college O
, O
i O
find O
that O
the O
portability O
, O
longevity O
, O
and O
ease O
of O
use O
of O
this O
computer O
make O
me O
( O
shockingly O
) O
want O
to O
do O
homework O
more O
; O

without O
a O
big O
ol O
' O
clunky O
machine O
in O
my O
backpack O
, O
i O
feel O
like O
i O
can O
do O
programming O
homework O
anywhere O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
computer O
for O
students O
looking O
for O
a O
solid O
machine O
to O
get O
them O
through O
college O
. O

a O
great O
feature O
is O
the O
spotlight O
search O
: O
one O
can O
search O
for O
documents O
by O
simply O
typing O
a O
keyword O
, O
rather O
than O
parsing O
tens O
of O
file O
folders O
for O
a O
document O
. O

oh O
my O
goodness-i O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
. O

my O
hp O
is O
very O
heavy O
. O

not O
easy O
to O
carry O
. O

the O
battery O
has O
never O
worked O
well O
. O

the O
battery O
gets O
so O
hot O
it O
is O
scary O
. O

yet O
, O
hp O
wo O
n't O
do O
anything O
about O
the O
problem O
. O

i O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
hp O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
. O

when O
i O
got O
the O
computer O
back O
and O
realizwed O
it O
still O
was O
not O
correct O
hp O
told O
me O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty O
and O
now O
it O
was O
my O
problem O
. O

so O
, O
you O
can O
imagine O
how O
unhappy O
i O
am O
with O
this O
item O
. O

currently O
if O
i O
use O
the O
laptop O
i O
ca O
n't O
sit O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
because O
it O
will O
burn O
my O
legs O
. O

i O
did O
contact O
hp O
and O
share O
how O
unhappy O
i O
am O
. O

well O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
a O
bunch O
. O

but O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
they O
( O
the O
company O
) O
would O
not O
and O
could O
not O
do O
anything O
about O
my O
problem O
. O

i O
would O
say O
if O
you O
want O
to O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
machines O
be O
careful O
. O

and O
, O
if O
you O
are O
going O
to O
deal O
with O
hp O
be O
careful O
. O

in O
my O
house O
, O
hp O
is O
a O
nasty O
word O
. O

since O
i O
purchased O
my O
toshiba O
netbook O
, O
i O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
, O
i O
have O
a O
laptob O
and O
a O
desktop O
. O

the O
netbook O
is O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
take O
to O
bed O
and O
carry O
around O
with O
me O
. O

the O
screen O
takes O
some O
getting O
use O
to O
, O
because O
it O
is O
smaller O
than O
the O
laptop O
. O

i O
have O
not O
have O
any O
problems O
. O

the O
notebook O
pc O
, O
toshiba O
qosmio O
is O
the O
best O
gift O
my O
father O
could O
have O
ever O
gotten O
me O
. O

he O
gave O
me O
this O
pc O
about O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
up O
to O
this O
point O
im O
still O
sitting O
here O
using O
it O
. O

its O
still O
going O
. O

it O
is O
in O
the O
best O
condition O
and O
has O
a O
really O
high O
quality O
. O

this O
is O
something O
i O
would O
deffinately O
reccomend O
to O
someone O
. O

you O
will O
not O
regret O
buying O
such O
a O
great O
thing O
like O
this O
! O

it O
ca O
n't O
get O
any O
better O
. O

waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

ease O
of O
use O
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
i O
love O
about O
my O
mac O
. O

this O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O
and O
windows O
7 O
is O
great O
! O

it O
's O
fast O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
easy O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
easy O
to O
hook O
to O
my O
wireless O
network O
. O

it O
's O
even O
easy O
to O
hook O
up O
to O
other O
wireless O
networks O
. O

the O
battery O
does O
n't O
last O
long O
but O
i O
'm O
sure O
an O
upgrade O
battery O
would O
solve O
that O
problem O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
laptop O
in O
a O
way O
though O
that O
needs O
a O
long O
battery O
life O
so O
it O
's O
perfect O
for O
me O
. O

most O
everything O
is O
fine O
with O
this O
machine O
: O
speed O
, O
capacity O
, O
build O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
do O
n't O
understand O
is O
that O
the O
resolution O
of O
the O
screen O
is O
n't O
high O
enough O
for O
some O
pages O
, O
such O
as O
yahoo O
! O
mail O
. O

yes O
, O
i O
have O
it O
on O
the O
highest O
available O
setting O
. O

i O
bought O
it O
for O
really O
cheap O
also O
and O
it O
's O
amazing O
. O

easy O
to O
start O
up O
and O
does O
not O
overheat O
as O
much O
as O
other O
laptops O
. O

recommended O
to O
people O
as O
their O
first O
laptop O
. O

plain O
and O
simple O
, O
it O
( O
laptop O
) O
runs O
great O
and O
loads O
fast O
. O

easy O
to O
carry O
, O
can O
be O
taken O
anywhere O
, O
can O
be O
hooked O
up O
to O
printers O
, O
headsets O
. O

love O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
space O
like O
a O
regular O
computer O
. O

i O
'm O
already O
hooked O
on O
the O
sleek O
look O
and O
dependability O
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
shown O
. O

being O
a O
pc O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
, O
it O
's O
taking O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
os O
of O
a O
mac O
but O
i O
'm O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
. O

the O
unibody O
design O
is O
edgy O
and O
durable O
. O

the O
led O
backlit O
display O
makes O
my O
pictures O
pop O
so O
much O
more O
. O

i O
'm O
learning O
the O
finger O
options O
for O
the O
mousepad O
that O
allow O
for O
quicker O
browsing O
of O
web O
pages O
. O

granted O
, O
it O
's O
still O
a O
very O
new O
laptop O
but O
in O
comparison O
to O
my O
previous O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
, O
my O
mac O
boots O
up O
noticeably O
quicker O
. O

a O
key O
contributor O
that O
led O
me O
to O
mac O
is O
the O
art O
aspect O
. O

they O
have O
developed O
excellent O
proprietary O
software O
for O
editing O
video O
and O
pictures O
and O
i O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
utilizing O
these O
tools O
on O
the O
regular O
. O

i O
'm O
excited O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
what O
this O
powerful O
machine O
has O
to O
offer O
and O
encourage O
others O
to O
do O
the O
same O
. O

it O
's O
more O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
it O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

great O
product O
, O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
great O
graphics O
. O

one O
drawback O
, O
i O
wish O
the O
keys O
were O
backlit O
. O

i O
'm O
glad O
i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
, O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
few O
( O
$ O
100 O
) O
extra O
dollars O
. O

it O
had O
most O
of O
the O
features O
and O
all O
of O
the O
power O
that O
i O
wanted O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
machine O
. O

i O
was O
n't O
really O
as O
concerned O
about O
portability O
( O
it O
's O
a O
very O
large O
laptop O
) O
but O
it O
's O
not O
hard O
to O
move O
around O
or O
take O
on O
a O
trip O
which O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

i O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
machine O
! O

i O
love O
the O
size O
, O
keyboard O
, O
the O
functions O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
really O
have O
a O
complaint O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
good O
quality O
and O
good O
price O
. O

perfect O
trifecta O
! O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

the O
salesman O
talked O
us O
into O
this O
computer O
away O
from O
another O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
and O
we O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
with O
software O
problems O
and O
just O
not O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

this O
is O
my O
first O
dell O
i O
heard O
their O
customer O
service O
was O
lacking O
and O
that O
they O
were O
working O
on O
improving O
it O
! O

i O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
9 O
months O
ago O
! O

the O
dvd O
burner O
broke O
after O
burning O
3 O
dvd O
'd O
during O
that O
time O
! O

they O
sent O
me O
a O
replacement O
part O
and O
without O
informing O
me O
are O
requiring O
that O
i O
return O
it O
within O
15 O
days O
or O
contact O
them O
and O
let O
them O
know O
the O
broken O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
later O
. O

i O
am O
currently O
out O
of O
town O
and O
called O
to O
inform O
them O
the O
broken O
part O
would O
be O
returned O
when O
i O
got O
back O
in O
town O
. O

if O
this O
is O
an O
improvement O
in O
customer O
service O
then O
i O
would O
hate O
too O
see O
what O
it O
was O
before O
! O

i O
spoke O
to O
4 O
different O
people O
and O
was O
told O
they O
needed O
to O
transfer O
me O
to O
a O
5th O
person O
! O

needless O
to O
say O
i O
told O
them O
no O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
day O
and O
hung O
up O
! O

i O
can O
guarantee O
this O
will O
be O
the O
last O
dell O
i O
will O
ever O
purchase O
! O

breaking O
within O
1 O
year O
of O
purchase O
and O
speaking O
to O
4+ O
people O
to O
report O
the O
damaged O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
late O
! O

i O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
company O
or O
their O
products O
! O
! O
! O
! O

so O
far O
, O
a O
great O
product O
. O

high O
price O
tag O
, O
however O
. O

still O
trying O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
it O
. O

it O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
dell O
ever O
made O
. O

it O
is O
hard O
to O
fix O
and O
makes O
it O
a O
hassle O
to O
own O
one O
. O

breaks O
easily O
. O

only O
good O
thing O
is O
the O
graphics O
quality O
. O

there O
are O
so O
many O
wonderful O
features O
and O
benefits O
to O
the O
new O
macbook O
! O

the O
# O
1 O
reason O
that O
is O
always O
repeated O
. O

no O
viruses O
! O

this O
laptop O
is O
fast O
and O
you O
will O
literally O
learn O
all O
you O
can O
do O
with O
this O
dynamo O
by O
just O
watching O
the O
online O
tutorials O
. O

i O
am O
loyal O
to O
apple O
. O

the O
macbooks O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

they O
're O
easy O
, O
fun O
, O
powerful O
and O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

the O
great O
18 O
month O
same O
as O
cash O
financing O
and O
advance O
protection O
plan O
which O
includes O
accidents O
like O
spills O
. O
, O
which O
apple O
does O
n't O
offer O
, O
is O
why O
i O
bought O
my O
macbook O
at O
best O
buy O
. O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
! O

this O
just O
keeps O
having O
it O
's O
hard O
drive O
replaced O
! O

acer O
wo O
n't O
replace O
the O
laptop O
. O

the O
manufacturer O
's O
warranty O
only O
covers O
replacement O
/ O
repair O
of O
parts O
. O

this O
thing O
is O
a O
lemon O
. O

this O
macbook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value O
. O

its O
ease O
of O
use O
and O
the O
top O
service O
from O
apple- O
be O
it O
their O
phone O
assistance O
or O
bellying O
up O
to O
the O
genius O
bar- O
can O
not O
be O
beat O
. O

suffice O
it O
to O
say O
, O
my O
macbook O
pro O
keeps O
me O
going O
with O
its O
long O
battery O
life O
and O
blazing O
speed O
. O

it O
does O
run O
a O
little O
warm O
but O
that O
is O
a O
negligible O
concern O
. O

i O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
receive O
the O
toshiba O
l455 O
as O
a O
gift/bonus O
for O
some O
work O
i O
had O
done O
for O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
! O

i O
have O
owned O
it O
only O
two O
months O
! O

i O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
since O
the O
day O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
! O

my O
first O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
pre-loaded O
norton O
firewall O
/ O
security O
program O
. O

it O
would O
not O
let O
me O
connect O
to O
my O
wifi O
system O
where O
i O
lived O
. O

it O
took O
toshiba O
tech O
support O
4 O
calls O
and O
4 O
different O
techs O
to O
correct O
the O
problem O
. O

then O
just O
the O
other O
day O
, O
my O
left O
`` O
mouse O
'' O
button O
snapped O
! O

being O
only O
2 O
months O
old O
, O
i O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
! O

buyer O
beware O
. O

this O
one O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
might O
be O
a O
lemon O
! O

it O
rarely O
works O
and O
when O
it O
does O
it O
's O
incredibly O
slow O
. O

i O
have O
had O
to O
take O
it O
to O
the O
geek O
squad O
guys O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
because O
it O
has O
had O
viruses O
3 O
times O
and O
i O
have O
not O
even O
had O
it O
for O
more O
then O
4 O
months O
! O

*if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
laptop O
, O
this O
is O
not O
it O
! O

like O
the O
price O
and O
operation O
. O

some O
features O
arent O
friendly O
( O
volume O
wheel O
, O
sound O
quality O
, O
etc O
. O

but O
, O
for O
the O
cost O
this O
is O
a O
winner O
. O

i O
absolutely O
love O
my O
mac O
! O

i O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
my O
life O
without O
it O
anymore O
! O

it O
's O
perfect O
for O
everything O
and O
runs O
faster O
than O
an O
average O
pc O
! O

i O
've O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
major O
problems O
with O
the O
laptop O
except O
that O
the O
plastic O
piece O
that O
covers O
the O
usb O
port O
wires O
have O
all O
come O
off O
. O

apparently O
they O
are O
defective O
since O
they O
are O
not O
securely O
attached O
. O

i O
can O
barely O
use O
any O
usb O
devices O
because O
they O
will O
not O
stay O
connected O
properly O
. O

i O
called O
toshiba O
and O
they O
want O
me O
to O
be O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
while O
they O
look O
at O
the O
problem O
. O

i O
think O
i O
might O
rather O
suffer O
for O
something O
that O
is O
simple O
to O
fix O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
was O
the O
worst O
laptop O
i O
've O
ever O
bought O
. O

i O
spent O
alot O
of O
money O
on O
this O
product O
and O
its O
been O
a O
nightmare O
. O

and O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
company O
has O
been O
a O
even O
worse O
nightmare O
. O

i O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
fix O
in O
perfect O
condition O
but O
for O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
. O

they O
sent O
it O
back O
with O
a O
huge O
crack O
in O
it O
and O
it O
still O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

and O
that O
was O
the O
fourth O
time O
ive O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
get O
fixed O
. O

its O
been O
a O
year O
and O
am O
still O
waiting O
to O
see O
what O
there O
going O
to O
do O
about O
my O
laptop O
. O

so O
if O
anyones O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
computer O
or O
laptop O
you O
should O
stay O
far O
far O
away O
from O
any O
that O
have O
the O
name O
toshiba O
on O
it O
... O

i O
saved O
for O
this O
laptop O
for O
3 O
months O
and O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
personally O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

the O
display O
on O
this O
computer O
is O
the O
best O
i O
've O
seen O
in O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
very O
long O
and O
very O
convienent O
. O

a O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
is O
well O
, O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

i O
've O
been O
a O
pc O
user O
and O
i O
just O
finally O
switched O
and O
i O
am O
never O
going O
back O
. O

it O
is O
amazing O
. O

in O
the O
first O
moth O
of O
owning O
this O
computer O
its O
hardrive O
failed O
which O
had O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

after O
replacing O
the O
hard O
drive O
the O
battery O
stopped O
working O
( O
3 O
months O
of O
use O
) O
which O
was O
frustrating O
. O

then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger O
stopped O
working O
so O
i O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware O
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

a O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O
computer O
: O
do O
not O
buy O
it O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
last O
. O

has O
a O
5-6 O
hour O
battery O
life O
. O

much O
faster O
than O
my O
old O
windows O
laptop O
that O
died O
on O
me O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
lightweight O
. O

was O
very O
much O
worth O
the O
price O
i O
paid O
. O

this O
netbook O
went O
bad O
on O
me O
after O
3 O
days O
. O

there O
is O
a O
blank O
lighted O
screen O
when O
i O
start O
and O
that O
is O
all O
. O

i O
am O
also O
upset O
with O
cr O
for O
giving O
a O
good O
rating O
. O

i O
purchased O
this O
netbook O
after O
my O
original O
toshiba O
laptop O
crashed O
right O
after O
the O
warranty O
expired O
. O

three O
weeks O
after O
i O
bought O
the O
netbook O
, O
the O
screen O
quit O
working O
. O

i O
baby O
my O
electronics O
so O
i O
know O
for O
a O
fact O
it O
was O
defective O
and O
not O
anything O
that O
i O
did O
to O
it O
. O

overall O
i O
feel O
this O
netbook O
was O
poor O
quality O
, O
had O
poor O
performance O
, O
although O
it O
did O
have O
great O
battery O
life O
when O
it O
did O
work O
. O

took O
the O
netbook O
on O
a O
vacation O
trip O
and O
i O
was O
able O
to O
do O
whatever O
i O
wanted O
to O
do O
without O
lugging O
a O
much O
heavier O
laptop O
. O

to O
my O
mind O
much O
more O
usable O
than O
the O
toy O
called O
an O
ipad O
. O

the O
so O
called O
laptop O
runs O
to O
slow O
and O
i O
hate O
it O
! O

do O
not O
buy O
it O
! O

it O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
ever O

the O
image O
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
soud O
is O
excelent O
. O

i O
love O
ths O
notebook O
. O

i O
love O
the O
glass O
touchpad O
. O

easy O
learning O
curve O
. O

also O
the O
display O
is O
exceptional O
! O

i O
have O
loved O
this O
since O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

the O
battery O
is O
really O
long O
. O

the O
features O
are O
great O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
it O
needs O
is O
better O
speakers O
. O

small O
and O
light O
weight O
. O

speakers O
too O
small O
to O
be O
of O
any O
real O
use O
. O

keyboard O
good O
sized O
and O
wasy O
to O
use O
. O

i O
like O
it O
! O

meets O
my O
needs O
perfectly O
and O
is O
light O
enough O
for O
this O
senior O
to O
carry O
without O
affecting O
my O
arthritis O
. O

needless O
to O
say O
, O
not O
to O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
! O

the O
design O
is O
awesome O
, O
quality O
is O
unprecedented O
. O

apparently O
well-built O
and O
gorgeous O
to O
look O
at O
, O
the O
i5 O
macbook O
pro O
is O
a O
winning O
combination O
of O
price O
and O
performance O
. O

it O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
investments O
i O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

consumer O
report O
recommended O
toshiba O
. O

am O
very O
glad O
i O
bought O
it O
, O
great O
netbook O
, O
low O
price O
. O

very O
good O
quality O
and O
well O
made O
. O

great O
pick O
for O
portability O
and O
affordability O
. O

the O
black O
model O
also O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
seamless O
appearance O
- O
one O
of O
the O
better O
looking O
notebooks O
i O
've O
seen O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
screen O
resolutions O
! O

if O
you O
need O
an O
affordable O
, O
entry-level O
laptop O
, O
this O
will O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O

i O
dislike O
the O
weight O
and O
size O
, O
cubersome O
. O

i O
dislike O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
speakers O
. O

overall O
, O
it O
's O
ok O
. O

laptop O
is O
advertised O
as O
a O
15 O
'' O
but O
the O
casing O
looks O
like O
that O
of O
a O
17 O
'' O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
very O
large O
and O
barely O
fits O
in O
any O
carrying O
cases O
. O

peformance O
is O
good O
for O
the O
price O
. O

if O
you O
're O
not O
wanting O
to O
be O
mobile O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
laptop O
to O
sit O
on O
a O
desk O
. O

had O
to O
have O
this O
computer O
repaired O
twice O
in O
the O
first O
5 O
months O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

not O
good O
for O
a O
person O
who O
gets O
online O
daily O
. O

may O
be O
better O
for O
the O
occasional O
web O
surfer O
. O

i O
just O
got O
this O
laptop O
for O
college O
, O
and O
so O
far O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

i O
really O
wanted O
a O
mac O
over O
a O
pc O
because O
i O
used O
a O
mac O
in O
high O
school O
. O

it O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
use O

good O
keyboard O
, O
long O
battery O
life O
, O
largest O
hard O
drive O
and O
windows O
7 O
. O

and O
toshiba O
is O
a O
quality O
supplier O
. O

i O
love O
this O
little O
one O
. O

the O
keyboard O
has O
a O
wonderful O
nature O
feel O
. O

i O
like O
it O
better O
than O
my O
big O
dell O
laptop O
. O

seriously O
considering O
a O
larger O
laptop O
to O
replace O
the O
dell O

great O
battery O
life O
. O

keyboard O
is O
reasonable O
size O
. O

small O
screen O
somewhat O
limiting O
but O
great O
for O
travel O
. O

charger O
seems O
large O
for O
this O
class O
of O
computer O
. O

great O
laptop O
for O
the O
price O
, O
works O
well O
with O
action O
pack O
games O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
i O
have O
, O
is O
the O
key O
broad O
is O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O
, O
would O
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O
lighter O
then O
it O
is O
. O

but O
other O
then O
that O
i O
would O
give O
this O
product O
a O
4 O
in O
hafe O
stars O
. O

good O
for O
every O
day O
computing O
and O
web O
browsing O
. O

a O
great O
computer O
for O
light O
home O
use O
and O
business O
use O
. O

might O
not O
make O
the O
avid O
gamer O
happy O
but O
i O
do O
n't O
really O
think O
that O
is O
what O
this O
computer O
is O
designed O
for O
. O

crisp O
screen O
, O
great O
battery O
life O
, O
and O
plenty O
of O
storage O
. O

very O
happy O
. O

my O
son O

a O
hard O
time O
financially O

is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
well O

it O
was O
easy O
for O
him O
to O
get O
started O
. O

now O
he O
mows O
yards O
so O
he O
can O
earn O
the O

able O
to O
set-up O
with O
labtops O
themselves O
within O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

it O
works O
fine O
with O
our O
wireless O
and O
they O
've O
had O
not O
problems O
. O

it O
's O
a O
great O
product O
for O
a O
great O
price O
! O

waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

ease O
of O
use O
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
i O
love O
about O
my O
mac O
. O

purchased O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
a O
friend O
. O

the O
service O
i O
received O
from O
toshiba O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
the O
call O
of O
duty O
. O

my O
friend O
reports O
the O
notebook O
is O
astonishing O
in O
performance O
, O
picture O
quality O
, O
and O
ease O
of O
use O
. O

it O
is O
extremely O
portable O
and O
easily O
connects O
to O
wifi O
at O
the O
library O
and O
elsewhere O
. O

just O
what O
the O
doctor O
ordered O
. O

2nd O
mac O
book O
i O
have O
purchased O
from O
macconnection O
. O

i O
can O
not O
be O
happier O
with O
the O
service O
or O
product O
. O

power O
supply O
went O
bad O
after O
2 O
weeks O
-- O

after O
much O
effort O
and O
10 O
days O
asus O
replaced O
it O

the O
wifi O
is O
very O
weak O
. O

i O
have O
other O
computers O
that O
get O
strong O
signals O
that O
do O
n't O
drop O
in O
places O
that O
this O
`` O
net O
'' O
book O
loses O
its O
signal O
. O

summary O
: O
spend O
your O
money O
elsewhere O

this O
is O
a O
nicely O
sized O
laptop O
with O
lots O
of O
processing O
power O
and O
long O
battery O
life O
. O

love O
it O
so O
far O
. O

the O
toshiba O
net O
book O
operates O
very O
well O
. O

the O
only O
objection O
i O
have O
is O
that O
after O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
windows O
7 O
system O
is O
a O
starter O
and O
charges O
for O
the O
upgrade O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
netbook O
for O
traveling O
, O
and O
it O
's O
great O
- O
light O
, O
functional O
, O
and O
meets O
my O
needs O
. O

the O
touchpad O
is O
extremely O
sensitive O
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
drawback O
. O

otherwise O
, O
i O
love O
it O
! O

i O
shopped O
around O
before O
buying O
. O

i O
was O
n't O
really O
sure O
i O
wanted O
to O
spend O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
! O

it O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
after O
all O
. O

i O
love O
it O
! O

i O
should O
have O
bought O
one O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

not O
enough O
time O
for O
me O
to O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
! O

i O
've O
had O
the O
macbook O
pro O
15 O
for O
about O
three O
weeks O
, O
and O
it O
really O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

i O
have O
only O
had O
pcs O
with O
windows O
before O
so O
this O
takes O
a O
little O
getting O
use O
to O
. O

the O
real O
stand O
out O
on O
this O
computer O
is O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard O
and O
it O
's O
speed O
. O

it O
is O
fast O
booting O
up O
, O
shutting O
down O
, O
and O
connection O
with O
the O
internet O
. O

the O
one O
thing O
i O
wish O
it O
had O
was O
a O
detailed O
hardcopy O
manuel O
. O

i O
think O
the O
manual O
is O
somewhere O
on O
the O
hard O
drive O
, O
but O
i O
rather O
have O
a O
hard O
copy O
. O

if O
what O
you O
need O
is O
a O
machine O
to O
do O
some O
surfing O
, O
email O
checking O
, O
word O
processing O
, O
and O
watching O
a O
movie O
or O
two O
, O
this O
is O
the O
machine O
you O
want O
. O

it O
's O
priced O
very O
reasonable O
and O
works O
very O
well O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

if O
you O
want O
a O
little O
more O
custom O
ability O
, O
drop O
a O
few O
bucks O
and O
upgrade O
to O
one O
of O
the O
more O
robust O
versions O
of O
win O
7 O
and O
grab O
a O
2gb O
stick O
of O
memory O
to O
spice O
it O
all O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
. O

( O
i O
found O
a O
2gb O
stick O
for O
a O
bit O
under O
$ O
50 O
) O

nice O
and O
portable O
and O
definitely O
a O
decent O
enough O
system O
to O
keep O
you O
entertained O
while O
sitting O
in O
the O
airplane O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
, O
or O
at O
the O
hotel O
taking O
care O
of O
some O
last O
minute O
details O
and O
documents O
. O

my O
only O
issues O
are O
: O

the O
screen O
/ O
video O
resolution O
wo O
n't O
increase O
to O
a O
higher O
resolution O
then O
1024 O
x O
60 O

that O
being O
said O
, O
it O
still O
runs O
video O
in O
full O
screen O
decently O
. O

the O
sound O
is O
a O
bit O
quiet O
if O
you O
're O
on O
a O
plane O
, O
this O
can O
easily O
be O
overcome O
with O
a O
decent O
pair O
of O
head O
phones O
. O

bottom O
line O
, O
i O
doubt O
you O
'd O
be O
overly O
disappointed O
if O
you O
invest O
in O
this O
machine O
. O

okay O
, O
let O
's O
just O
start O
out O
by O
saying O
i O
am O
in O
no O
way O
a O
computer O
techy O
. O

i O
am O
a O
wife O
, O
mom O
and O
a O
school O
teacher O
and O
a O
college O
student O
. O

trying O
to O
balance O
all O
of O
my O
roles O
leaves O
very O
little O
time O
for O
me O
to O
do O
anything O
, O
so O
i O
want O
to O
manage O
my O
time O
i O
do O
have O
to O
be O
the O
most O
efficient O
. O

i O
work O
on O
a O
pc O
at O
home O
and O
have O
used O
pc O
all O
through O
college O
. O

i O
use O
the O
computer O
to O
basically O
check O
emails O
, O
surf O
the O
web O
, O
print O
coupons O
and O
for O
my O
college O
papers O
. O

i O
was O
getting O
extrememly O
frustrated O
when O
i O
would O
want O
to O
do O
these O
simple O
taks O
that O
i O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
for O
things O
to O
download O
or O
virus O
that O
would O
clog O
up O
my O
pc O
. O

it O
would O
take O
up O
too O
much O
time O
to O
do O
reaearch O
for O
my O
papers O
and O
i O
would O
be O
up O
hours-just O
because O
the O
computer O
was O
too O
slow O
. O

my O
brother O
is O
a O
computer O
wiz O
and O
would O
laugh O
at O
me O
because O
he O
used O
an O
apple O
. O

finally O
, O
i O
could O
n't O
take O
it O
anymore O
and O
ordered O
my O
apple O
. O

yes O
, O
i O
thought O
the O
expese O
was O
a O
little O
much O
, O
but O
i O
now O
realize O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

i O
love O
my O
apple O
, O
it O
is O
quick O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

i O
've O
had O
to O
call O
apple O
support O
to O
set O
up O
my O
new O
printer O
and O
have O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
with O
helpful O
, O
english O
speaking O
( O
from O
vancouver O
) O
techs O
that O
walked O
me O
through O
the O
processes O
to O
help O
me O
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
of O
how O
satisfied O
i O
am O
with O
their O
product O
and O
help O
aftermarket O
. O

money O
and O
time O
well O
spent O

my O
budget O

premium O
, O
to O

professional O
was O
a O
snap O
; O

both O
upgrades O
were O
quickly O
accomplished O
after O
purchasing O
the O
necessary O
product O
key O
. O

other O
installed O
features O
, O
such O
as O
certain O
printer O
software O
, O
are O
also O
most O
attractive O
. O

ever O
since O
i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
, O
so O
far O
i O
've O
experience O
nothing O
but O
constant O
break O
downs O
of O
the O
laptop O
and O
bad O
customer O
services O
i O
received O
over O
the O
phone O
with O
toshiba O
customer O
services O
hotlines O
. O

i O
constantly O
had O
to O
send O
my O
laptop O
in O
for O
services O
every O
3 O
months O
and O
it O
always O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
same O
problem O
that O
they O
said O
they O
had O
already O
fixed O
. O

toshiba O
customer O
services O
will O
indirectly O
deal O
with O
your O
problems O
by O
constantly O
tranferring O
you O
from O
one O
country O
to O
another O
, O
and O
i O
am O
not O
kidding O
you O
, O
i O
called O
different O
hours O
of O
the O
day O
and O
you O
'll O
get O
someone O
else O
from O
another O
country O
trying O
to O
get O
you O
to O
tell O
them O
your O
life O
story O
all O
over O
again O
, O
since O
they O
make O
it O
sound O
like O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
your O
history O
list O
of O
your O
calls O
right O
in O
front O
of O
them O
. O

it O
's O
a O
long O
and O
tirring O
process O
that O
after O
a O
while O
it O
seems O
like O
their O
game O
plan O
was O
to O
wear O
you O
out O
so O
you O
would O
want O
to O
give O
up O
on O
contacting O
them O
. O

and O
at O
one O
point O
, O
they O
blame O
me O
for O
installing O
a O
bad O
memory O
stick O
when O
i O
upgrade O
my O
memory O
for O
the O
first O
time O
during O
my O
purchase O
of O
the O
laptop O
( O
i O
bought O
the O
memory O
stick O
they O
recomended O
) O
. O

long O
story O
short O
, O
since O
i O
experience O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
my O
laptop O
every O
since O
i O
bought O
it O
from O
day O
one O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
ask O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
or O
a O
refund O
of O
what O
i O
pay O
for O
a O
crapy O
laptop O
, O
but O
just O
an O
extension O
of O
my O
laptop O
warranty O
for O
another O
year O
, O
they O
made O
a O
big O
deal O
of O
out O
that O
and O
after O
so O
many O
calls O
and O
complaints O
about O
their O
products O
and O
services O
, O
they O
finally O
gave O
in O
. O

was O
this O
product O
worth O
my O
time O
and O
money O
to O
ever O
want O
to O
purchase O
another O
products O
that O
is O
toshiba O
or O
relating O
to O
toshiba O
? O

probably O
not O
ever O
again O
. O

i O
'll O
rather O
be O
out O
of O
date O
then O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
toshiba O
. O

remember O
to O
do O
your O
research O
first O
before O
consider O
buying O
a O
toshiba O
product O
. O

all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
w-o-w O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
insane O
! O
! O
! O

it O
's O
so O
nice O
to O
look O
at O
and O
the O
keys O
are O
easy O
to O
type O
with O
. O

i O
bought O
a O
protector O
for O
my O
key O
pad O
and O
it O
works O
great O
: O
) O

this O
is O
definitely O
a O
computer O
worth O
the O
money O
; O

the O
mouse O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
different O
than O
what O
you O
're O
used O
to O
though- O
it O
has O
one O
big O
flat O
panel O
and O
one O
full O
bar O
( O
instead O
of O
two O
separate O
ones O
) O
to O
click O
with- O
but O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
quite O
quickly O
. O

and O
the O
best O
part O
is O
that O
it O
even O
comes O
with O
a O
free O
printer O
( O
when O
they O
have O
a O
certain O
promotion O
/ O
offer O
going O
, O
of O
course O
) O
! O

overall O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
definitely O
a O
keeper O
with O
its O
simple O
yet O
stylish O
design O
and O
its O
array O
of O
fantastic O
colors O
to O
choose O
from O
. O

the O
apple O
team O
also O
assists O
you O
very O
nicely O
when O
choosing O
which O
computer O
is O
right O
for O
you O
: O
) O

obviously O
, O
this O
macbook O
is O
p-e-r-f-e-c-t O
for O
me O
because O
it O
does O
exactly O
what O
i O
need O
in O
an O
easy-to-function O
way O
. O

definitely O
recommended O
! O
! O
! O

not O
a O
bad O
laptop O
, O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O

the O
lcd O
screen O
stopped O
working O
on O
mine O
after O
10 O
months O
. O

i O
could O
not O
find O
a O
phone O
number O
anywhere O
to O
call O
an O
actual O
live O
person O
for O
tech O
support O
and O
had O
to O
result O
the O
their O
online O
chat O
. O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
i O
was O
told O
, O
was O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty O
and O
i O
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
even O
though O
i O
had O
the O
receipt O
in O
front O
of O
me O
proving O
it O
still O
had O
2 O
months O
left O
on O
the O
warranty O

dealing O
with O
the O
support O
drone O
on O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
chat O
was O
sheer O
torture O
. O

english O
must O
have O
been O
his O
third O
or O
fourth O
language O
. O

his O
language O
was O
so O
bad O
i O
swore O
i O
was O
taking O
the O
turing O
test O
, O
and O
it O
was O
failing O
. O

after O
trying O
to O
get O
some O

disconnected O
on O

vain O
help O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
the O
warranty O
was O
still O
valid O
. O

after O
4 O
days O
, O
being O
denied O
6 O
times O
and O
told O
off O
once O
, O
i O
managed O
to O
get O
through O
and O
was O
able O
to O
send O
them O
a O
scanned O
copy O
of O
the O
receipt O
. O

after O
that O
the O
said O
it O
was O
under O
warranty O
. O

then O
they O
had O
me O
jump O
through O
many O
hoops O
and O
questions O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
find O
another O
way O
to O
invalidate O
me O
. O

after O
they O
found O
no O
other O
way O
, O
they O
told O
me O
to O
courier O
it O
to O
them O
( O
since O
they O
do O
n't O
allow O
the O
use O
of O
the O
post O
office O
) O
at O
my O
expense O
, O
and O
sent O
me O
a O
4 O
page O
list O
of O
very O
specific O
packaging O
instructions O
to O
follow O
or O
it O
would O
n't O
be O
covered O
. O

i O
managed O
to O
comply O
with O
these O
too O
and O
now O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
if O
they O
can O
find O
another O
way O
to O
screw O
me O
. O

they O
really O
do O
have O
the O
worlds O
very O
worst O
repair O
service O
. O

this O
computer O
gets O
very O
hot O
, O
before O
shutting O
down O
. O

it O
is O
not O
ideal O
for O
children O
because O
of O
the O
temp O
. O

i O
contacted O
hp O
about O
this O
situation O
and O
was O
given O
excuses O
, O
without O
results O
. O

they O
did O
n't O
even O
try O
to O
assist O
me O
or O
even O
offer O
a O
replacement O
. O

i O
will O
never O
purchase O
a O
hp O
again O
ever O
. O

let O
's O
just O
get O
this O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
i O
love O
apple O
! O

so O
this O
review O
might O
be O
a O
tad O
bit O
bias O
. O

but O
the O
macbook O
is O
the O
best O
! O

it O
is O
super O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

all O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
it O
works O
. O

it O
is O
very O
durable O
, O
i O
am O
pretty O
rough O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
electronics O
and O
it O
has O
taken O
it O
all O
with O
no O
reprecutions O
yet O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
do O
any O
high O
tech O
stuff O
on O
it O
, O
just O
write O
papers O
, O
check O
mail O
, O
and O
sometimes O
play O
games O
, O
so O
i O
ca O
n't O
reccomend O
it O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
. O

but O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
you O
probably O
would O
n't O
be O
here O
. O
: O
) O

in O
the O
past O
four O
years O
i O
've O
had O
it O
i O
have O
never O
once O
gotten O
a O
virus O
. O

i O
did O
have O
to O
replace O
the O
battery O
once O
, O
but O
that O
was O
only O
a O
couple O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
's O
been O
working O
perfect O
ever O
since O
. O

i O
would O
definitely O
reccomend O
this O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
an O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
stylish O
, O
fun O
, O
awesome O
computer O
. O

also O
it O
is O
very O
good O
for O
college O
students O
who O
just O
need O
a O
reliable O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
computer O
. O

hope O
this O
helped O
! O

no O
laptop O
is O
perfect O
, O
but O
sometimes O
you O
just O
find O
a O
computer O
that O
works O
for O
you O
. O

this O
laptop O
does O
everything O
i O
need O
it O
to O
very O
well O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
so O
that O
the O
entire O
family O
had O
a O
computer O
in O
the O
living O
room O
; O

the O
two O
of O
us O
use O
it O
regularly O
. O

i O
wanted O
something O
that O
had O
a O
new O
intel O
core O
processors O
and O
hdmi O
port O
so O
that O
we O
could O
hook O
it O
up O
directly O
to O
our O
tv O
. O

the O
best O
thing O
about O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
price O
along O
with O
some O
of O
the O
newer O
features O
. O

the O
screen O
is O
bright O
and O
the O
keyboard O
is O
nice O
; O

i O
find O
myself O
using O
the O
10-key O
more O
than O
i O
thought O
i O
would O
. O

battery O
is O
lasting O
about O
6 O
hours O
as O
i O
am O
surfing O
the O
web O
on O
sundays O
while O
checking O
football O
scores O
and O
watching O
funny O
youtube O
videos O
. O

for O
those O
that O
care O
about O
noise O
this O
thing O
does O
n't O
really O
make O
any O
; O

the O
i3 O
processor O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
run O
hot O
and O
the O
fan O
rarely O
turns O
on O
. O

i O
took O
off O
a O
star O
because O
the O
machine O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
junk O
software O
on O
it O
. O

i O
wish O
toshiba O
would O
allow O
their O
customers O
to O
select O
an O
option O
that O
only O
boots O
the O
os O
at O
setup O
and O
removes O
all O
the O
unnecessary O
stuff O
. O

once O
i O
removed O
all O
the O
software O
the O
laptop O
loads O
in O
15-20 O
seconds O
. O

this O
is O
not O
a O
serious O
gaming O
laptop O
or O
a O
serious O
media O
machine O
; O

my O
niece O
and O
nephew O
have O
played O
a O
few O
web O
games O
and O
it O
runs O
anything O
that O
does O
n't O
require O
a O
dedicated O
video O
card O
. O

overall O
i O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

i O
looked O
around O
and O
based O
off O
my O
price/features O
comparison O
from O
a O
brand O
i O
trusted O
i O
landed O
here O
. O

great O
, O
quick O
laptop O
for O
the O
money O
. O

right O
size O
and O
weight O
for O
portability O
. O

battery O
life O
needs O
more O
life O
. O

battery O
is O
not O
upgradable O
to O
a O
longer O
life O
battery O
. O

both O
my O
husband O
and O
i O
have O
this O
model O
toshiba O
. O

i O
love O
everything O
about O
it O
. O

the O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
battery O
only O
last O
1.5-2.0 O
hrs O
when O
not O
plugged O
in O
. O

i O
would O
like O
at O
least O
a O
4 O
hr O
. O
battery O
life O
. O

otherwise O
, O
all O
other O
features O
are O
a O
1 O

this O
mac O
is O
great O
! O

lightweight O
, O
long O
battery O
life O
, O
excellent O
transition O
from O
pc O
; O

this O
has O
been O
nothing O
but O
a O
headache O
since O
we O
purchased O
it O
. O

i O
will O
never O
buy O
( O
refurbished O
) O
again O
, O
i O
do O
n't O
cae O
how O
cheap O
it O
is O
. O

i O
'll O
wait O
and O
save O
up O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

just O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
on O
this O
. O

i O
tried O
giving O
it O
0 O
stars O
but O
i O
had O
to O
choose O
at O
least O
one O
, O
but O
imo O
no O
stars O

summary O
: O
dont O
buy O
hp O
. O

if O
you O
buy O
, O
pray O
you O
dont O
have O
major O
prolems O
. O

runs O
hot O

i O
thought O
we O
were O
paying O
for O
quality O
in O
our O
decision O
to O
buy O
an O
apple O
product O
. O

unfortunately O
, O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

after O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
of O
owning O
my O
macbook O
pro O
, O
the O
monitor O
has O
completely O
died O
. O

because O
we O
did O
not O
purchase O
the O
extended O
warranty O
in O
time O
, O
we O
are O
on O
the O
hook O
for O
the O
repair O
. O

the O
genius O
at O
the O
apple O
store O
advised O
me O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
about O
my O
use O
of O
the O
computer O
that O
caused O
this O
failure O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
he O
said O
, O
about O
10 O
% O
of O
their O
products O
fail O
. O

hmmm O
- O
that O
high O
failure O
rate O
sure O
is O
n't O
reflected O
in O
the O
retail O
price O
. O

this O
purchase O
opened O
me O
to O
the O
world O
of O
macbooks O
, O
and O
i O
am O
impressed O
with O
the O
intuition O
of O
the O
design O
, O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
product O
, O
and O
the O
excellent O
technological O
advances O
associated O
with O
it O
. O

this O
is O
the O
third O
macbook O
pro O
in O
our O
family O
. O

i O
bought O
my O
first O
macbook O
after O
seeing O
the O
product O
demonstrated O
. O

then O
2 O
of O
my O
nephews O
were O
going O
into O
music O
and O
both O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
macbook O
pro O
. O

now O
they O
are O
believers O
in O
the O
product O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
has O
great O
screen O
quality O
, O
and O
every O
so O
light O
weight O
. O

i O
own O
other O
macs O
but O
always O
find O
myself O
navigation O
to O
the O
macbook O
pro O
to O
get O
my O
work O
done O
. O

this O
little O
netboook O
is O
helping O
me O
get O
work O
done O
! O

i O
can O
do O
pretty O
much O
75 O
% O
of O
what O
i O
do O
on O
my O
desktop O
on O
my O
kitchen O
table O
. O

i O
homeschool O
my O
kids O
and O
with O
this O
netbook O
next O
to O
my O
desk O
we O
get O
to O
teaching O
and O
illustrating O
without O
skipping O
a O
beat O
. O

i O
am O
first O
time O
mac O
buyer O
and O
am O
amazed O
at O
features O
and O
ease O
of O
use O
the O
mac O
offers O
. O

i O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
mom O
and O
she O
reports O
that O
the O
battery O
life O
lasts O
all O
day O
for O
her O
, O
it O
's O
very O
lightweight O
, O
and O
the O
response O
for O
the O
computing O
she O
's O
doing O
( O
internet O
focused O
activity O
: O
mail O
, O
research O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
is O
excellent O
; O

she O
ca O
n't O
tell O
the O
difference O
between O
it O
and O
her O
regular O
desktop O
system O
. O

the O
overall O
build O
quality O
of O
the O
unit O
is O
excellent O
and O
she O
'd O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
else O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
. O

if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
something O
to O
fly O
through O
those O
massive O
spreadsheets O
or O
play O
a O
graphics-intensive O
game O
, O
you O
'd O
be O
better O
off O
getting O
a O
machine O
aimed O
at O
that O
segment O
of O
the O
market O
. O

previous O
laptops O
were O
pc O
's O
, O
still O
have O
them O
, O
but O
the O
mac O
osx O
is O
a O
clean O
and O
smooth O
operating O
system O
. O

still O
testing O
the O
battery O
life O
as O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
better O
, O
but O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
upgrade O
. O

probably O
as O
good O
as O
you O
can O
get O
in O
a O
netbook O
, O
does O
everything O
i O
ask O
for O
and O
has O
some O
very O
good O
unexpected O
pluses O
. O

has O
met O
or O
exceeded O
my O
needs O
for O
a O
compact O
travel O
device O
. O

so O
far O
, O
so O
good O
! O

i O
've O
been O
impressed O
with O
the O
battery O
life O
and O
the O
performance O
for O
such O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
memory O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
only O
windows O
7 O
starter O
is O
included O
. O

strong O
performance O
in O
this O
device O
makes O
use O
of O
fun O
and O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
the O
era O
of O
speed O

this O
device O
serves O
all O
modern O
requirements O
is O
a O
very O
strong O
game O
and O
is O
very O
useful O
for O
designers O
. O

enjoy O
that O
toshib O
force O
and O
durability O
unparalleled O

needs O
longer O
lasting O
battery O
, O
more O
than O
1 O
to O
2 O
hrs O
. O

needs O
power O
and O
mouse O
cable O
to O
plug O
in O
back O
instead O
of O
side O
, O
in O
the O
way O
of O
operating O
a O
mouse O
in O
small O
area O
. O

for O
the O
use O
it O
was O
purchased O
for O
it O
is O
a O
good O
laptop O
. O

comfterbale O
to O
use O
light O
easy O
to O
transport O
. O

i O
love O
this O
product O
because O
it O
is O
toshiba O
and O
its O
15.6 O
'' O
. O

it O
has O
no O
camera O
but O
, O
i O
can O
always O
buy O
and O
install O
one O
easy O
. O

i O
had O
a O
usb O
connect O
but O
, O
i O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
because O
it O
is O
not O
compatible O
. O

that O
's O
the O
downside O
for O
me O
. O

but O
, O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

satisfy O
what O
i O
paid O
for O
it O
. O

good O
monitor O
and O
performed O
well O
. O

i O
am O
using O
the O
external O
speaker- O
sound O
is O
good O
. O

best O
thing O
is O
i O
can O
use O
existing O
32 O
bit O
old O
programs O
. O

i O
recommend O
for O
word O
processing O
and O
internet O
users O
. O

the O
toshiba O
laptop O
i O
am O
using O
is O
easier O
to O
use O
than O
most O
i O
have O
tried O
. O

the O
games O
included O
are O
very O
good O
games O
. O

i O
am O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
this O
laptop O
better O
than O
my O
last O
one O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
one O
to O
my O
friends O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
because O
of O
the O
performance O
to O
price O
ratio O
. O

it O
works O
great O
for O
general O
internet O
use O
, O
microsoft O
office O
apps O
, O
home O
bookkeeping O
, O
etc O
. O

it O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
frills O
, O
but O
i O
did O
n't O
need O
any O
, O
and O
being O
able O
to O
buy O
what O
i O
needed O
, O
and O
not O
more O
than O
i O
needed O
was O
very O
important O
. O

this O
computer O
i O
used O
daily O
nice O
compact O
design O
. O

excellent O
speed O
for O
processing O
data O
. O

and O
if O
you O
are O
a O
game O
player O
it O
works O
with O
world O
of O
warcraft O
wonderfully O
. O

now O
when O
i O
order O
i O
did O
not O
go O
full O
scale O
for O
the O
webcam O
or O
full O
keyboard O
i O
wanted O
something O
for O
basics O
of O
being O
easy O
to O
carry O
when O
i O
use O
crutchs O
or O
wheelchair O
and O
with O
a O
backpack O
laptop O
bag O
. O

all O
in O
all O
great O
item O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

bought O
it O
to O
use O
mostly O
for O
oline O
classes O
. O

i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
overall O
its O
great O
! O

aside O
from O
the O
trial O
software O
and O
the O
short O
battery O
life O
, O
lack O
of O
a O
webcam O
, O
its O
great O
. O

fast O
, O
great O
visual O
! O

oh O
yea O
, O
has O
no O
numeric O
pad O
on O
the O
side O
. O

i O
use O
that O
alot O
on O
my O
desktop O
, O
so O
i O
am O
adjusting O
to O
not O
having O
it O
. O

2nd O
best O
computer O
in O
the O
world O
only O
one O
way O
this O
computer O
might O
become O
the O
best O
is O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
upgreade O
patches O
to O
make O
less O
easier O
for O
people O
to O
hack O
into O

sells O
for O
the O
same O
as O
a O
netbook O
without O
sacrificing O
size O
. O

my O
favorite O
part O
of O
this O
computer O
is O
that O
it O
has O
a O
vga O
port O
so O
i O
can O
connect O
it O
to O
a O
bigger O
screen O
. O

great O
wifi O
too O
. O

the O
screen O
is O
a O
little O
glary O
, O
and O
i O
hated O
the O
clicking O
buttons O
, O
but O
i O
got O
used O
to O
them O
. O

overall O
for O
the O
money O
this O
is O
a O
good O
deal O
. O

there O
is O
no O
number O
pad O
to O
the O
right O
of O
the O
keyboard O
which O
is O
a O
bummer O
. O

the O
speakers O
are O
terrible O
and O
are O
probably O
the O
cheapest O
ones O
i O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
a O
laptop O
so O
if O
your O
planning O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
i O
suggest O
you O
get O
something O
better O
. O

while O
the O
keyboard O
itself O
is O
alright O
, O
the O
plate O
around O
it O
is O
cheap O
plastic O
and O
makes O
a O
hollow O
sound O
when O
using O
the O
mouse O
command O
buttons O
. O

i O
am O
overall O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
toshiba O
satellite O
, O
i O
like O
the O
extra O
features O
, O
i O
love O
the O
windows O
7 O
home O
premium O
. O

the O
battery O
life O
has O
not O
decreased O
since O
i O
bought O
it O
, O
so O
i O
'm O
thrilled O
with O
that O
. O

i O
also O
love O
the O
design O
, O
the O
looks O
, O
the O
feel O
, O
and O
the O
my O
toshiba O
feature O
is O
wonderfull O
. O

i O
would O
easly O
reccomend O
this O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

couldnt O
not O
use O
it O
. O

tried O
to O
make O
a O
recovey O
disk O
wouldnt O
get O
passed O
the O
first O
recovery O
disk O
. O

defective O
software O
. O

returned O
it O
to O
walmart O
. O

this O
was O
the O
second O
computer O
and O
brand O
bought O
that O
day O
. O

i O
would O
like O
to O
have O
volume O
buttons O
rather O
than O
the O
adjustment O
that O
is O
on O
the O
front O
. O

i O
also O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
touchpad O
that O
caused O
the O
mouse O
pointer O
to O
jump O
all O
over O
the O
screen O
. O

i O
went O
to O
toshiba O
online O
help O
and O
found O
some O
suggestions O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

one O
of O
them O
seems O
to O
have O
worked O
. O

its O
a O
good O
laptop O
for O
its O
value O
. O

registration O
/ O
1st O
use O
is O
easy O
. O

features O
like O
the O
font O
are O
very O
block-like O
and O
old O
school O
. O

would O
like O
more O
trendy O
, O
high O
tech O
features O
. O

the O
start O
menu O
is O
not O
the O
easiest O
thing O
to O
navigate O
due O
to O
the O
stacking O
. O

keys O
stick O
periodically O
and O
i O
havent O
had O
the O
laptop O
for O
45 O
days O
yet O
. O

came O
fully O
loaded O
- O
good O
. O

seems O
to O
slow O
down O
occassionally O
but O
can O
run O
many O
applications O
( O
ie O
internet O
tabs O
, O
programs O
, O
etc O
) O
simultaneously O
. O

i O
'm O
really O
impressed O
with O
the O
quality O
and O
performance O
for O
the O
price O
of O
the O
computer O
. O

graphics O
are O
clean O
and O
sharp O
, O
internet O
interfaces O
are O
seamless O
. O

only O
issue O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
and O
i O
'm O
fixing O
that O
by O
adding O
more O
ram O
. O

sound O
card O
is O
limited O
though O
. O

the O
laptop O
is O
very O
lightweight O
, O
can O
easily O
carry O
around O
in O
a O
knapsack O
full O
of O
text O
books O
and O
it O
barely O
adds O
any O
weight O
. O

it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
in O
one O
of O
my O
purses O
! O

windows O
7 O
starter O
is O
terrific O
( O
no O
you O
ca O
n't O
change O
the O
background O
) O
but O
i O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
, O
i O
use O
it O
just O
for O
school O
work O
. O

the O
battery O
life O
is O
amazing O
, O
the O
versitility O
is O
outstanding O
. O

the O
ease O
of O
set O
up O
was O
terrific O
. O

i O
was O
even O
able O
to O
uninstall O
mcaffe O
and O
install O
one O
of O
my O
symantec O
licenses O
with O
a O
no O
issues O
whatsoever O
. O

i O
had O
to O
adjust O
my O
mousepad O
sensitivity O
, O
because O
it O
is O
very O
sensitive O
. O

keyboard O
is O
great O
, O
very O
quiet O
for O
all O
the O
typing O
that O
i O
do O
. O

screen O
is O
crystal O
clear O
, O
yes O
it O
's O
small O
- O
but O
it O
's O
a O
netbook O
! O

awesome O
laptop O
and O
the O
perfect O
size O
to O
carry O
around O
in O
college O
. O

i O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
long O
the O
battery O
lasted O
on O
a O
single O
charge O
. O

i O
loaded O
windows O
7 O
via O
bootcamp O
and O
it O
works O
flawlessly O
! O

simply O
amazing O
computer O
! O
! O

i O
really O
like O
the O
mac O
15.4in O
. O
notebook O
, O
but O
its O
very O
pricey O
. O

heck O
, O
i O
like O
all O
mac O
computers O
, O
but O
they O
're O
all O
way O
too O
pricey O
for O
the O
kind O
of O
economy O
the O
u.s. O
is O
going O
through O
. O

love O
the O
graphics O
, O
awesome O
programs O
( O
including O
garageband O
) O
, O
and O
really O
cool O
default O
background O
. O

but O
, O
like O
i O
said O
before O
, O
the O
only O
reason O
i O
do O
n't O
currently O
have O
a O
mac O
laptop O
is O
because O
all O
of O
their O
laptops O
are O
too O
pricey O
. O

waiting O
for O
the O
i7 O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
, O
great O
value O
for O
the O
price O
. O

bigger O
hd O
, O
better O
graphics O
card O
, O
and O
a O
bid O
hd O
. O

there O
is O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
system O
. O

i O
have O
used O
pc O
's O
and O
converting O
to O
this O
macbook O
pro O
was O
easy O
. O

if O
you O
have O
the O
money O
i O
suggest O
going O
for O
the O
i7 O
. O

this O
is O
my O
first O
personal O
satellite O
purchase O
but O
had O
very O
good O
experience O
through O
previous O
satellite O
work O
issued O
laptops O
. O

i O
mainly O
use O
it O
for O
email O
, O
internet O
, O
and O
managing O
personal O
files O
( O
pics O
, O
vids O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
. O

i O
occassionaly O
use O
it O
for O
work O
via O
vpn O
and O
it O
has O
not O
given O
me O
any O
problems O
. O

the O
screen O
is O
nice O
and O
the O
images O
comes O
very O
clear O
, O
the O
keyboard O
and O
the O
fit O
just O
feels O
right O
. O

i O
consider O
myself O
an O
average O
user O
and O
this O
computer O
serves O
my O
need O
. O

the O
price O
is O
another O
driving O
influence O
that O
made O
me O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
. O

i'ts O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
higher-end O
laptops O
, O
but O
this O
fits O
my O
budget O
and O
the O
features O
i O
need O
. O

i O
normally O
dont O
participate O
in O
reviews O
/ O
surveys O
but O
this O
laptop O
has O
not O
given O
me O
any O
problems O
and O
hope O
to O
share O
my O
thoughts O
... O

another O
satisfied O
customer O

it O
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
than O

worth O
the O
price O
. O

this O
computer O
was O
awful O
! O

i O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
from O
dell O
ever O
again O
do O
to O
how O
awful O
it O
worked O
and O
how O
i O
was O
treated O
by O
the O
company O
. O

the O
computer O
first O
started O
malfunctioning O
3 O
months O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

it O
does O
not O
keep O
internet O
signals O
no O
matter O
where O
you O
bring O
it O
. O

the O
system O
it O
comes O
with O
does O
not O
work O
properly O
, O
so O
when O
trying O
to O
fix O
the O
problems O
with O
it O
it O
started O
not O
working O
at O
all O
. O

when O
calling O
dell O
for O
help O
, O
reurn O
, O
or O
a O
new O
computer O
they O
were O
not O
useful O
and O
left O
it O
up O
to O
myself O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

one O
year O
of O
trying O
to O
fix O
the O
computer O
by O
myself O
, O
with O
help O
of O
friends O
, O
and O
even O
help O
from O
computer O
experts O
i O
have O
given O
up O
on O
trying O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

this O
computer O
was O
awful O
, O
i O
would O
never O
recomend O
it O
to O
another O
person O
. O

those O
moments O
in O
thime O
where O
you O
want O
to O
throw O
something O
against O
the O
wall O
? O

yeah O
, O
i O
wanted O
to O
throw O
that O
lap O
top O
out O
the O
window O
and O
light O
it O
on O
fire O
. O

that O
's O
how O
frustrating O
it O
was O
. O

it O
is O
so O
simple O
to O
use O
, O
i O
use O
it O
more O
than O
my O
desktop O
. O

it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
it O
cost O
, O
very O
good O
investment O
. O

the O
new O
macbook O
pro O
15 O
inch O
i7 O
is O
nothing O
short O
of O
amazing O
. O

the O
speed O
is O
incredible O
and O
i O
am O
more O
than O
satisfied O
. O

yes O
, O
a O
mac O
is O
much O
more O
money O
than O
the O
average O
laptop O
out O
there O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
in O
style O
, O
speed O
and O
just O
cool O
factor O
. O

bought O
from O
wal-mart O
, O
i O
believe O
that O
this O
laptop O
was O
a O
repaired O
item O
. O

this O
laptop O
was O
bad O
from O
the O
first O
day O
of O
use O
-- O
-- O
brought O
it O
back O
to O
store O
for O
return O
of O
money O
. O

now O
am O
very O
aprehensive O
about O
toshiba O
laptops O
. O

will O
not O
every O
buy O
another O
-- O
-- O
-- O
-- O
lou O

this O
is O
a O
great O
value O
for O
the O
money O
. O

we O
purchased O
this O
as O
a O
back O
up O
computer O
after O
our O
more O
expensive O
hp O
needed O
to O
be O
repaired O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

we O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
at O
all O
. O

the O
body O
is O
a O
bit O
cheaply O
made O
so O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
how O
long O
it O
holds O
up O
. O

overall O
though O
, O
for O
the O
money O
spent O
it O
's O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

i O
still O
see O
the O
benefits O
of O
a O
pc O
when O
i O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
do O
something O
on O
my O
mac O
. O

but O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
so O
professional O
. O

its O
very O
nice O
and O
once O
you O
learn O
the O
features O
you O
will O
be O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
such O
a O
sophisticated O
computer O
. O

for O
example O
, O
when O
my O
husband O
turns O
the O
light O
out O
while O
i O
'm O
on O
the O
computer O
. O
the O
screen O
brightness O
automatically O
adjusts O
. O

the O
keyboard O
is O
like O
no O
other O
laptop O
keyboard O
. O

it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
type O
on O
and O
feels O
great O
- O
besides O
the O
added O
feature O
that O
the O
keyboard O
is O
lighted O
. O

oh O
, O
it O
is O
such O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

one O
suggestion O
i O
do O
have O
, O
is O
to O
not O
bother O
getting O
microsoft O
office O
for O
the O
mac O
expecting O
it O
will O
work O
just O
like O
you O
knew O
it O
to O
on O
a O
pc O
. O

its O
office O
compatible O
, O
but O
the O
features O
and O
its O
functioning O
is O
all O
new O
again O
so O
you O
might O
as O
well O
save O
the O
money O
and O
just O
learn O
the O
pre O
installed O
mac O
programs O
. O

having O
someone O
give O
you O
a O
quick O
tour O
of O
how O
to O
's O
is O
the O
best O
. O

so O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
frustrated O
the O
first O
few O
weeks O
. O

i O
get O
a O
ton O
of O
compliments O
on O
its O
size O
, O
and O
speaking O
as O
someone O
who O
regularly O
commutes O
on O
a O
bus O
, O
i O
can O
attest O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
size O
computer O
if O
you O
're O
restricted O
to O
the O
width O
of O
your O
body O
for O
computing O
room O
. O

very O
long-life O
battery O
( O
up O
to O
10-11 O
hours O
depending O
on O
how O
you O
configure O
power O
level O
settings O
) O
. O

i O
upgraded O
the O
memory O
and O
replaced O
the O
base O
windows O
7 O
starter O
to O
win O
7 O
home O
, O
and O
it O
runs O
just O
fine O
. O

i O
play O
a O
lot O
of O
casual O
games O
online O
, O
and O
the O
touchpad O
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
wish O
this O
had O
was O
the O
option O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
touchpad O
with O
a O
button O
like O
my O
big O
16 O
'' O
laptop O
does O
. O

i O
would O
n't O
play O
a O
first-person O
shooter O
with O
this O
, O
mind O
, O
but O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
run O
ms O
office O
, O
email O
, O
chat O
, O
download O
a O
video O
, O
listen O
to O
music O
from O
a O
certain O
fruit-named O
music O
store O
, O
and O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
highly O
portable O
yet O
powerful O
netbook O
to O
do O
that O
all O
in O
, O
i O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
checking O
this O
out O
. O

the O
downside O
to O
this O
netbook O
is O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
for O
any O
netbook O
: O
screen O
size O
is O
not O
something O
i O
'd O
stare O
at O
for O
the O
entire O
10-11 O
hours O
of O
battery O
life O
five O
days O
a O
week O
. O

additional O
caveat O
: O
the O
base O
installation O
comes O
with O
some O
toshiba-specific O
software O
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
to O
a O
user O
's O
liking O
. O

i O
have O
used O
both O
pcs O
and O
macs O
and O
i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
really O
really O
love O
my O
mac O
book O
pro O
. O

while O
most O
people O
say O
that O
pcs O
hold O
functionality O
and O
value O
and O
macs O
are O
just O
pretty O
to O
look O
at O
, O
i O
think O
there O
's O
something O
to O
be O
said O
about O
the O
simplicity O
of O
macs O
. O

everything O
from O
the O
design O
to O
the O
os O
is O
simple O
and O
to O
the O
point O
. O

love O
it O
love O
it O
love O
it O
! O

it O
really O
is O
perfect O
for O
work O
and O
play O
. O

i O
am O
able O
to O
play O
720p O
and O
1080p O
media O
files O
just O
fine O
with O
it O
. O

everything O
i O
have O
tried O
has O
worked O
and O
i O
never O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
wall O
charger O
cause O
the O
battery O
is O
so O
awesome O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
n't O
perfect O
about O
this O
netbook O
is O
the O
speakers O
, O
they O
are O
not O
loud O
at O
all O
but O
i O
expected O
that O
. O

i O
upgraded O
it O
's O
ram O
to O
2gb O
, O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

lots O
of O
preloaded O
software O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
i O
had O
to O
add O
1 O
gb O
ram O
, O
the O
computer O
was O
kinda O
slow O
. O

tosiba O
has O
a O
good O
reputation O
, O
my O
llast O
computer O
was O
an O
acer O
. O

this O
is O
starting O
off O
good O
. O

what O
a O
great O
little O
laptop O
. O

maybe O
not O
the O
cutting O
edge O
( O
satellite O
l455d O
) O
but O
it O
is O
a O
workhorse O
. O

i O
bought O
it O
to O
use O
in O
college O
and O
it O
is O
perfect O
. O

i O
dual O
boot O
with O
linux O
and O
that O
other O
security-prone O
os O
and O
it O
performs O
flawlessly O
. O

i O
made O
a O
perfect O
decision O
when O
i O
bought O
the O
toshiba O
! O

excellent O
product O
for O
the O
money O
. O

no O
problems O
, O
no O
lock O
ups O
, O
no O
disappointments O
. O

not O
super O
fancy O
, O
but O
not O
super O
expensive O
either O
. O

have O
had O
many O
higher O
priced O
computers O
crash O
and O
burn O
long O
before O
ever O
got O
to O
use O
all O
that O
great O
memory O
and O
speed O
, O
etc O
. O

highly O
recommend O
for O
daily O
use O
. O

we O
now O
own O
two O
of O
these O
, O
identical O
. O

as O
an O
owner O
of O
a O
toshiba O
satalite O
laptop O
computer O
things O
you O
should O
know O
before O
you O
buy O
. O

the O
computer O
itself O
is O
a O
good O
product O
but O
the O
repair O
depot O
stinks O
. O

i O
have O
had O
to O
send O
in O
my O
laptop O
three O
times O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
. O

two O
of O
the O
times O
was O
in O
one O
month O
. O

i O
had O
in O
the O
past O
a O
dell O
laptop O
and O
they O
sent O
me O
the O
items O
it O
needed O
or O
they O
sent O
a O
repair O
technician O
to O
my O
house O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

toshiba O
does O
not O
send O
any O
one O
out O
unless O
you O
have O
paid O
extra O
to O
have O
the O
on O
site O
repair O
done O
. O

i O
would O
tell O
the O
technician O
i O
knew O
exactly O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
but O
they O
did O
not O
listen O
and O
i O
had O
to O
go O
through O
a O
bunch O
of O
junk O
to O
get O
them O
to O
tell O
me O
i O
needed O
to O
send O
the O
computer O
in O
. O

this O
computer O
that O
i O
have O
has O
had O
issues O
with O
the O
keyboard O
where O
it O
lost O
half O
the O
keyboard O
functions O
. O

as O
well O
as O
having O
the O
plug O
in O
the O
computer O
come O
loose O
. O

this O
has O
happened O
three O
times O
so O
far O
. O

two O
times O
with O
in O
one O
month O
. O

i O
am O
not O
one O
to O
throw O
things O
like O
this O
around O
but O
it O
is O
a O
laptop O
so O
carrying O
it O
around O
does O
seem O
to O
mean O
it O
will O
be O
jerked O
possibly O
a O
little O
, O
while O
driving O
a O
car O
and O
carrying O
it O
into O
where O
ever O
you O
are O
using O
it O
. O

so O
having O
the O
ac O
plug O
go O
out O
on O
me O
and O
get O
lose O
or O
i O
could O
actually O
here O
it O
inside O
my O
computer O
on O
two O
of O
the O
three O
times O
is O
not O
good O
. O

it O
still O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
little O
lose O
now O
but O
so O
far O
seems O
to O
be O
hanging O
in O
there O
. O

the O
mac O
book O
pro O
performs O
flawlessly O
. O

never O
had O
a O
single O
problem O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
. O

while O
i O
mostly O
use O
it O
for O
email O
, O
internet O
and O
gaming O
, O
i O
'm O
confident O
all O
other O
applications O
live O
up O
to O
the O
high O
standard O
i O
've O
come O
to O
appreciate O
from O
mac O
laptops O
. O

worth O
the O
investment O
and O
truly O
a O
fine O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
this O
little O
netbook O
did O
everything O
i O
asked O
of O
it O
, O
including O
streaming O
the O
everyday O
video O
you O
're O
bound O
to O
encounter O
checking O
mail O
and O
websites O
( O
my O
biggest O
complaint O
previously O
) O
. O

it O
even O
has O
a O
great O
webcam O
, O
and O
skype O
works O
very O
well O
. O

the O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
spend O
over O
$ O
100 O
on O
just O
a O
webcam O
underscores O
the O
value O
of O
this O
machine O
. O

the O
windows O
7 O
starter O
is O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
a O
great O
way O
to O
think O
about O
using O
your O
netbook O
: O
basics O
, O
basics O
, O
basics O
. O

i O
wiped O
nearly O
everything O
off O
of O
it O
, O
installed O
openoffice O
and O
firefox O
, O
and O
i O
am O
operating O
an O
incredibly O
efficient O
and O
useful O
machine O
for O
a O
great O
price O
. O

this O
netbook O
is O
a O
perfect O
supplementary O
computer O
to O
another O
laptop O
or O
desktop O
( O
my O
wife O
and O
i O
have O
another O
laptop O
) O
, O
or O
if O
you O
are O
a O
user O
who O
uses O
the O
computer O
for O
simple O
tasks O
. O

i O
use O
this O
for O
my O
tutoring O
business O
, O
and O
since O
i O
'm O
always O
bouncing O
from O
student O
to O
student O
, O
it O
is O
ideal O
for O
portability O
and O
battery O
life O
( O
yes O
, O
it O
gets O
the O
8 O
hours O
as O
advertised O
! O
) O
. O

finally O
, O
i O
should O
note O
that O
i O
took O
the O
2gb O
ram O
stick O
from O
my O
old O
eeepc O
and O
installed O
it O
before O
i O
even O
powered O
on O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

asus O
has O
done O
an O
outstanding O
job O
of O
evolving O
their O
netbooks O
, O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
who O
both O
understands O
their O
needs O
and O
how O
netbooks O
can O
fit O
them O
. O

little O
short O
on O
ram O
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

the O
hinge O
design O
forced O
you O
to O
place O
various O
connections O
all O
around O
the O
computer O
, O
left O
right O
and O
front O
. O

the O
headphone O
and O
mic O
jack O
are O
in O
front O
of O
touch-pad O
making O
the O
touch-pad O
hard O
to O
use O
when O
using O
headphones O
/ O
mic O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
laptop O
was O
designed O
for O
right O
handed O
person O
. O

cords O
coming O
out O
the O
right O
for O
power O
plus O
cords O
coming O
out O
front O
for O
headphones O
/ O
mic O
plus O
network O
connection O
on O
left O
make O
for O
a O
very O
messy O
setup O
with O
cords O
going O
every O
direction O
. O

i O
love O
windows O
7 O
but O
i O
ca O
n't O
give O
toshiba O
any O
credit O
for O
that O
, O
unless O
y'all O
get O
serious O
about O
ergonomics O
and O
making O
required O
connections O
less O
obtrusive O
i O
will O
be O
looking O
to O
different O
manufacturer O
next O
time O
. O

i O
was O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
of O
a O
toshiba O
satellite O
l305d-s5934 O
laptop O
until O
it O
came O
time O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
under O
the O
toshiba O
warranty O
. O

the O
computer O
was O
shipped O
to O
their O
repair O
depot O
on O
june O
24 O
and O
returned O
on O
july O
2 O
seems O
like O
a O
short O
turn O
around O
time O
except O
the O
computer O
was O
not O
repaired O
when O
it O
was O
returned O
. O

i O
called O
their O
repair O
depot O
as O
was O
told O
they O
would O
send O
me O
a O
new O
box O
to O
return O
the O
computer O
to O
the O
repair O
depot O
. O

they O
were O
totally O
unconcerned O
that O
the O
computer O
was O
not O
correctly O
repaired O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

the O
computer O
is O
currently O
in O
west O
verginia O
doe O
to O
the O
method O
of O
shipping O
choosen O
by O
toshiba O
. O

the O
computer O
could O
have O
been O
shipped O
by O
priority O
mail O
through O
the O
usps O
for O
the O
same O
cost O
and O
arrived O
by O
noon O
on O
tue O
. O

instead O
it O
is O
sitting O
in O
west O
verginia O
waiting O
for O
ups O
to O
take O
two O
days O
to O
send O
me O
a O
box O
and O
two O
days O
for O
them O
to O
ship O
the O
computer O
some O
691 O
miles O
by O
air O
? O
to O
louisville O
ky O
. O

by O
air O
sounds O
more O
like O
by O
truck O
to O
me O
. O

and O
toshiba O
is O
totally O
unconcerned O
. O

the O
reaction O
of O
toshiba O
is O
there O
is O
nothing O
you O
can O
do O
about O
it O
so O
just O
sit O
back O
and O
except O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
are O
powerless O
and O
it O
is O
mind O
over O
matter O
. O

we O
do O
n't O
mind O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
matter O
. O

i O
would O
not O
recommend O
the O
purchase O
of O
this O
modle O
of O
toshiba O
computer O
or O
any O
toshiba O
product O
for O
that O
matter O
. O

when O
it O
come O
time O
for O
warranty O
service O
to O
toshiba O
you O
do O
n't O
matter O
. O

windows O
vista O
makes O
this O
computer O
almost O
unusable O
for O
online O
service O
. O

i O
've O
tried O
going O
back O
to O
xl O
but O
there O
still O
problems O
. O

the O
technical O
service O
for O
dell O
is O
so O
3rd O
world O
it O
might O
as O
well O
not O
even O
bother O
. O

just O
a O
bunch O
of O
idiots O
who O
's O
english O
as O
a O
5th O
language O
is O
forced O
at O
best O
. O

i O
'm O
all O
for O
saving O
money O
but O
dell O
needs O
to O
step O
it O
up O
. O

good O
price O
. O

basic O
computer O
. O

did O
n't O
work O
when O
shipped O
from O
walmart.com O
but O
went O
into O
a O
store O
and O
exchanged O
for O
a O
working O
laptop O
( O
same O
make O
/ O
model O
) O
. O

it O
has O
worked O
fine O
. O

handles O
all O
my O
basic O
media O
needs O
easily O
. O

can O
listen O
to O
my O
music O
and O
watch O
my O
videos O
with O
ease O
and O
with O
a O
great O
display O
. O

it O
is O
speedy O
when O
connected O
wirelessly O
to O
any O
network O
regardless O
if O
the O
connection O
is O
weak O
or O
not O
. O

it O
's O
a O
great O
prodcut O
to O
handle O
basic O
computing O
needs O
. O

i O
've O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
about O
a O
month O
now O
. O

it O
has O
served O
my O
needs O
quite O
nicely O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

the O
2 O
gb O
of O
ram O
is O
plenty O
, O
able O
to O
run O
windows O
7 O
and O
at O
least O
2 O
or O
3 O
other O
programs O
with O
next O
to O
no O
slowdown O
. O

the O
ati O
graphics O
card O
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
, O
definitely O
a O
good O
value O
if O
you O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
some O
slightly O
older O
games O
that O
a O
intel O
built-in O
card O
would O
have O
trouble O
with O
, O
such O
as O
half-life O
2 O
or O
even O
world O
of O
warcraft O
. O

my O
one O
complaint O
with O
this O
laptop O
is O
that O
i O
've O
noticed O
an O
electronic O
fuzz O
sound O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
headphone O
jack O
when O
headphones O
are O
plugged O
in O
. O

this O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
poor O
grounding O
and O
isolation O
between O
the O
components O
, O
and O
i O
'm O
hoping O
that O
it O
can O
be O
fixed O
with O
a O
ground O
loop O
isolator O
, O
but O
i O
still O
expected O
better O
product O
quality O
for O
this O
price O
range O
. O

other O
than O
that O
, O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
someone O
in O
need O
of O
a O
cheap O
laptop O
with O
semi-decent O
gaming O
capabilities O
. O

let O
me O
start O
with O
the O
good O
: O
so O
awesome O
. O

great O
os O
, O
fabulous O
improvements O
to O
the O
existing O
line O
bumping O
up O
the O
processor O
speed O
and O
adding O
the O
thunderbolt O
port O
. O

this O
is O
my O
second O
macbook O
. O

the O
first O
one O
i O
had O
was O
a O
2006 O
model O
, O
not O
the O
pro O
. O

i O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
. O

this O
one O
has O
had O
the O
same O
effect O
. O

i O
had O
upgraded O
my O
old O
macbook O
to O
lion O
, O
so O
i O
kind O
of O
knew O
what O
i O
was O
getting O
, O
but O
had O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
enjoy O
some O
of O
the O
awesome O
new O
multi-touch O
features O
. O

the O
improvements O
to O
the O
os O
have O
been O
relatively O
gradual O
, O
but O
substantive O
. O

the O
feel O
of O
this O
machine O
compared O
to O
the O
old O
macbook O
is O
far O
superior O
. O

the O
unibody O
construction O
is O
solid O
, O
sleek O
and O
beautiful O
. O

it O
is O
everything O
i O
'd O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O
from O
a O
look O
and O
feel O
standpoint O
, O
but O
somehow O
a O
bit O
more O
sturdy O
. O

for O
the O
not O
so O
good O
, O
i O
got O
the O
stock O
screen O
- O
which O
is O
very O
glossy O
. O

it O
's O
still O
beautiful O
and O
has O
better O
color O
reproduction O
than O
i O
could O
ever O
expect O
from O
a O
notebook O
. O

the O
reflectiveness O
of O
the O
display O
is O
only O
a O
minor O
inconvenience O
if O
you O
work O
in O
a O
controlled-lighting O
environment O
like O
me O
( O
i O
prefer O
it O
dark O
) O
or O
if O
you O
can O
crank O
up O
the O
brightness O
. O

my O
real O
problem O
with O
it O
? O

the O
statement O
of O
7 O
hour O
battery O
life O
is O
not O
just O
mere O
exaggeration O
-- O
it O
's O
a O
lie O
. O

i O
challenge O
anyone O
to O
show O
proof O
that O
through O
anywhere O
near O
normal O
use O
can O
get O
more O
than O
2.5 O
hrs O
out O
of O
it O
. O

the O
first O
full O
charge O
of O
this O
battery O
got O
me O
only O
about O
2 O
full O
hours O
. O

enabling O
the O
battery O
timer O
is O
useless O
. O

the O
`` O
time O
remaining O
'' O
goes O
from O
4 O
hours O
plus O
to O
less O
than O
2 O
hours O
over O
the O
span O
of O
about O
10 O
minutes O
. O

it O
's O
a O
joke O
. O

it O
's O
so O
bad O
that O
i O
'm O
thinking O
i O
only O
got O
half O
a O
battery O
or O
something O
. O

i O
know O
what O
7 O
hrs O
of O
battery O
looks O
like O
. O

this O
ai O
n't O
it O
. O

my O
only O
other O
complaint O
is O
that O
it O
gets O
really O
hot O
. O
: O
- O
) O

if O
you O
buy O
this O
- O
do O
n't O
go O
into O
it O
expecting O
7 O
hrs O
of O
battery O
life O
, O
and O
you O
'll O
be O
perfectly O
satisfied O
. O

the O
pro O
is O
a O
great O
product O
, O
i O
wish O
that O
the O
13 O
inch O
models O
came O
with O
the O
intel O
i O
processors O
and O
had O
a O
more O
comfortable O
edge O
( O
the O
edges O
hurt O
my O
wrists O
) O
. O

other O
than O
that O
its O
a O
great O
performing O
machine O
and O
well O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
and O
more O
. O

great O
product O
by O
apple O
with O
the O
new O
great O
looking O

, O
fast O

reliable O
, O

. O

i O

only O
complaint O

love O
this O
laptop O
wonderful O
price O
for O
what O
you O
get O
! O

would O
pay O
more O
for O
it O
if O
i O
had O
too O
! O

i O
purchased O
a O
toshiba O
satellite O
m60 O
( O
with O
harman/kardon O
speakers O
! O
) O
in O
december O
of O
2005 O
. O

it O
still O
serves O
me O
well O
both O
in O
business O
and O
home O
needs O
. O

it O
is O
, O
however O
, O
very O
heavy O
. O

i O
recently O
purchased O
the O
mini O
and O
absolutely O
love O
it O
! O

it O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
work O
and O
pleasure O
while O
traveling O
. O

i O
am O
totally O
satisfied O
with O
my O
little O
toshie O
! O

from O
the O
moment O
i O
opened O
the O
box O
to O
the O
present O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
joy O
. O

it O
is O
always O
reliable O
, O
never O
bugged O
and O
responds O
well O
. O

i O
love O
the O
operating O
system O
and O
the O
preloaded O
software O
. O

i O
am O
a O
freelance O
graphic O
artist O
. O

i O
need O
graphic O
power O
to O
run O
my O
adobe O
creative O
apps O
efficiently O
. O

this O
machine O
delivers O
. O

it O
is O
much O
faster O
than O
my O
desktop O
which O
is O
a O
core2 O
quad O
running O
at O
2.83 O
ghz O
. O

it O
is O
also O
extremely O
pleasing O
to O
the O
eyes O
without O
looking O
too O
much O
like O
an O
alienware O
gaming O
machine O
. O

i O
personally O
like O
the O
gaming O
look O
but O
needed O
a O
machine O
that O
delivered O
gaming O
performance O
while O
still O
looking O
professional O
in O
front O
of O
my O
customers O
. O

it O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
. O

it O
would O
be O
a O
load O
on O
long O
trips O
where O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
is O
required O
. O

if O
that O
is O
the O
case O
for O
you O
, O
i O
would O
suggest O
a O
pull-behind O
solution O
when O
looking O
at O
cases O
. O

had O
some O
trouble O
finding O
a O
case O
that O
it O
would O
fit O
in O
. O

this O
is O
an O
over-sized O
, O
18-inch O
laptop O
. O

most O
of O
the O
large O
bags O
are O
for O
a O
17 O
inch O
. O

you O
may O
need O
to O
special O
order O
a O
bag O
. O

it O
would O
n't O
fit O
in O
most O
17-inch O
bags O
. O

i O
was O
disappointed O
when O
i O
realized O
that O
the O
keyboard O
does O
n't O
light O
up O
on O
this O
model O
. O

it O
also O
does O
not O
have O
bluetooth O
. O

pay O
attention O
to O
the O
specs O
if O
you O
want O
these O
options O
. O

you O
'll O
need O
to O
upgrade O
and O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
for O
them O
. O

i O
should O
have O
been O
more O
observant O
. O

i O
was O
looking O
too O
closely O
at O
the O
other O
performance O
specs O
and O
while O
comparing O
, O
i O
took O
it O
for O
granted O
that O
these O
features O
were O
standard O
. O

they O
are O
not O
. O

overall O
, O
still O
a O
very O
nice O
machine O
. O

boots O
up O
fast O
and O
runs O
great O
! O

i O
'm O
pleased O
. O

the O
acer O
one O
compuer O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

i O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
generic O
brand O
computer O
but O
it O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

its O
fast O
, O
has O
high O
definition O
quality O
in O
the O
videos O
. O

the O
pictures O
are O
clear O
as O
can O
be O
. O

if O
i O
had O
to O
buy O
another O
computer O
, O
i O
would O
most O
definetly O
buy O
an O
acer O
one O
computer O
. O

heck O
, O
if O
i O
had O
enough O
' O
money O
, O
i O
would O
but O
it O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
someone O
. O

im O
glad O
that O
it O
has O
such O
great O
features O
in O
it O
. O

it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
built O
it O
web O
cam O
which O
is O
great O
because O
i O
can O
see O
an O
communicate O
with O
my O
family O
members O
back O
home O
. O

clear O
picture O
on O
it O
and O
everything O
. O

the O
one O
down O
side O
to O
it O
is O
that O
when O
i O
play O
a O
certin O
game O
on O
here O
, O
it O
tends O
to O
freeze O
up O
sometimes O
, O
but O
thats O
the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
this O
computer O
. O

the O
acer O
one O
computer O
that O
i O
bought O
is O
17 O
ince O
screen O
and O
its O
hard O
to O
find O
lap O
top O
bags O
for O
it O
, O
but O
i O
like O
the O
big O
screen O
on O
it O
. O

its O
good O
for O
playing O
my O
apps O
on O
facebook O
or O
watching O
movies O
. O

im O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
computer O
! O

well O
, O
i O
have O
to O
say O
since O
i O
bought O
my O
mac O
, O
i O
wo O
n't O
ever O
go O
back O
to O
any O
windows O
. O

it O
's O
solid O
. O

love O
the O
stability O
of O
the O
mac O
software O
and O
operating O
system O
. O

the O
only O
downfall O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
software O
i O
have O
wo O
n't O
work O
with O
mac O
and O
iwork O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
of O
it O
. O

it O
seems O
to O
be O
incompatible O
with O
everything O
else O
. O

but O
the O
machine O
is O
awesome O
and O
ilife O
is O
great O
and O
i O
love O
snow O
leopard O
x O
. O

i O
love O
to O
use O
it O
it O
is O
esay O
and O
light O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
durable O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
. O

i O
needed O
one O
to O
be O
able O
to O
carry O
to O
work O
everyday O
and O
this O
one O
seems O
to O
fit O
all O
of O
the O
criteria O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
great O
for O
work O
and O
doing O
my O
pictures O
. O

i O
am O
a O
huge O
computer O
person O
i O
love O
anykind O
of O
computer O
that O
works O
well O
, O
but O
when O
i O
got O
this O
one O
i O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
the O
way O
it O
works O
and O
how O
it O
runs O
its O
amazing O
. O

the O
programs O
are O
esay O
to O
use O
and O
are O
quick O
to O
process O
this O
computer O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

i O
can O
use O
it O
for O
all O
of O
my O
needs O
. O

i O
give O
this O
laptop O
a O
five O
star O
review O
i O
love O
it O
and O
it O
has O
done O
chams O
for O
me O
. O

if O
this O
computer O
every O
breaks O
down O
on O
me O
i O
will O
most O
definatly O
get O
the O
same O
one O
again O
. O

i O
think O
that O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
durrable O
laptop O
then O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

from O
the O
second O
you O
open O
the O
box O
you O
will O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
this O
computer O
! O

the O
os O
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
day O
that O
the O
laptop O
was O
purchased O
and O
continues O
to O
run O
flawlessly O
. O

the O
track O
pad O
to O
me O
is O
what O
really O
stands O
out O
though O
, O
you O
can O
do O
several O
different O
things O
with O
it O
just O
depending O
on O
how O
many O
fingers O
you O
use O
on O
the O
track O
pad O
, O
awesome O
thinking O
apple O
! O

have O
not O
yet O
needed O
any O
customer O
support O
with O
this O
yet O
so O
to O
me O
that O
is O
a O
great O
thing O
, O
which O
is O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
ahead O
of O
pc O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

the O
os O
is O
also O
very O
user O
friendly O
, O
even O
for O
those O
that O
switch O
from O
a O
pc O
, O
with O
a O
little O
practice O
you O
can O
take O
full O
advantage O
of O
this O
os O
! O

apple O
continues O
to O
shine O
and O
provide O
a O
much O
more O
enjoyable O
computer O
experience O
! O

from O
the O
start O
, O
when O
you O
open O
the O
box O
you O
see O
a O
completely O
different O
class O
of O
machine O
. O

the O
ease O
in O
which O
you O
set O
everything O
up O
is O
such O
that O
a O
child O
could O
do O
it O
. O

the O
screen O
is O
bright O
and O
clear O
, O
the O
operating O
system O
is O
solid O
and O
friendly O
to O
a O
novice O
. O

fast O
, O
fast O
and O
fast O
, O
the O
web O
pages O
just O
fly O
by O
. O

i O
had O
my O
iworks O
, O
itunes O
, O
email O
, O
ms O
office O
, O
network O
and O
printers O
set O
up O
and O
completely O
working O
perfectly O
within O
an O
hour O
. O

that O
includes O
transferring O
my O
music O
and O
movies O
. O

good O
bye O
blue O
screen O
and O
critical O
errors O
! O
! O
! O
! O

skype O
is O
just O
so O
dang O
cool O
with O
this O
machine O
too O
. O

i O
can O
hardly O
wait O
to O
see O
whats O
around O
the O
next O
corner O
. O

my O
iphone O
synced O
right O
up O
just O
like O
a O
person O
would O
expect O
, O
unlike O
the O
pcs O
in O
our O
lives O
. O

if O
only O
bill O
gates O
would O
read O
some O
of O
what O
is O
said O
here O
ms O
would O
do O
a O
better O
job O
. O

if O
your O
time O
is O
worth O
anything O
to O
you O
, O
if O
you O
are O
tired O
of O
rebooting O
, O
reformatting O
, O
reinstalling O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
drivers O
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
computer O
to O
work O
for O
you O
for O
a O
change O
, O
make O
the O
change O
to O
this O
computer O
. O

it O
is O
light O
and O
the O
battery O
last O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

very O
fast O
boot O
up O
and O
shut O
down O
. O

been O
a O
pc O
user O
for O
many O
, O
many O
years O
. O

let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
this O
machine O
is O
great O
. O

purchased O
for O
development O
purposes O
, O
but O
it O
has O
turned O
into O
my O
everyday O
laptop O
as O
well O
for O
surfing O
, O
e-mail O
, O
etc O
. O

i O
thought O
learning O
the O
mac O
os O
would O
be O
hard O
, O
but O
it O
is O
easily O
picked O
up O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
a O
pc O
. O

the O
most O
amazing O
part O
to O
me O
as O
a O
pc O
user O
is O
the O
startup O
and O
shutdown O
times O
- O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
very O
rarely O
have O
to O
restart O
the O
thing O
. O

the O
only O
time O
i O
have O
restarted O
is O
during O
system O
updates O
. O

great O
machine O
if O
you O
want O
to O
drop O
the O
cash O
for O
one O
. O

ok O
, O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
laptop O
series O
ever O
devised O
by O
apple O
. O

the O
case O
is O
carved O
out O
of O
a O
single O
block O
of O
aluminum O
. O

although O
i O
opted O
for O
the O
lowest O
end O
macbook O
pro O
, O
this O
thing O
holds O
its O
own O
. O

the O
processor O
screams O
, O
and O
because O
of O
the O
unique O
way O
that O
apple O
osx O
16 O
functions O
, O
most O
of O
the O
graphics O
are O
routed O
through O
the O
hardware O
rather O
than O
the O
software O
. O

that O
is O
how O
it O
is O
able O
to O
function O
better O
than O
any O
other O
pc O
. O

i O
have O
recommended O
this O
laptop O
to O
everyone O
i O
know O
who O
is O
buying O
one O
. O

i O
like O
it O
so O
much O
, O
i O
bought O
another O
just O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

took O
it O
back O
as O
it O
was O
defective O
. O

page O
just O
disapeared O
after O
you O
got O
yahoo O
or O
downloaded O
something O
. O

could O
n't O
keep O
a O
page O
up O
you O
were O
working O
on O
! O

was O
a O
great O
deal O
i O
will O
give O
that O
. O

the O
laptop O
preformed O
pretty O
well O
. O

it O
cant O
fuction O
well O
with O
lots O
of O
webpages O
open O
at O
once O
. O

it O
has O
times O
were O
it O
freezes O
for O
10 O
seconds O
and O
then O
starts O
again O
. O

the O
mouse O
on O
the O
pad O
, O
the O
left O
button O
always O
sticks O
. O

the O
mouse O
is O
way O
way O
way O
to O
sensitve O
. O

i O
tried O
turning O
it O
done O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
. O

the O
mouse O
jumps O
around O
all O
the O
time O
and O
it O
clicks O
stuff O
i O
dont O
want O
it O
too O
. O

its O
not O
bad O
just O
very O
very O
annoying O
. O

think O
i O
would O
spend O
little O
extra O
to O
get O
a O
better O
made O
laptop O
. O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

for O
the O
price O
and O
what O
i O
get O
out O
of O
it O
has O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

i O
always O
have O
used O
a O
tower O
home O
pc O
and O
jumped O
to O
the O
laptop O
and O
have O
been O
very O
satisfied O
with O
its O
performance O
. O

first O
things O
first O
, O
macbook O
pro O
has O
many O
applications O
to O
make O
life O
easier O
, O
unlike O
the O
windows O
computers O
. O

amazing O
quality O
! O

plus O
stylish O
. O

the O
big O
screen O
allows O
you O
to O
enjoy O
watching O
movies O
, O
pictures O
and O
etc O
! O

the O
flaws O
are O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
not O
for O
computer O
gamers O
because O
of O
the O
os O
x O
. O

mac O
is O
not O
made O
for O
gaming O
. O

but O
there O
's O
this O
application O
called O
boot O
camp O
which O
allows O
you O
to O
add O
another O
os O
x O
like O
windows O
. O

second O
, O
it O
gets O
scratches O
easily O
and O
when O
it O
gets O
old O
some O
thing O
may O
operated O

was O
not O
happy O
with O
one O
of O
the O
programs O
on O
it O
. O

it O
was O
not O
clear O
that O
the O
microsoft O
student O
edition O
that O
was O
loaded O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
was O
a O
six O
month O
trial O
. O

also O
, O
the O
extended O
warranty O
was O
a O
problem O
. O

the O
extended O
warranty O
for O
the O
$ O
4000 O
and O
up O
computers O
was O
the O
only O
one O
available O
for O
purchase O
on O
the O
drop O
drown O
menu O
. O

overall O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
the O
screen O
is O
perfect O
, O
great O
computer O
, O
my O
daughter O
loves O
. O

i O
took O
3-4 O
years O
researching O
brands O
and O
prices O
of O
laptops O
. O

i O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
laptop O
because O
it O
was O
the O
right O
price O
for O
what O
i O
need O
it O
. O

i O
did O
think O
it O
had O
a O
camera O
because O
that O
was O
one O
of O
my O
requirements O
, O
but O
forgot O
to O
check O
in O
the O
specifications O
on O
this O
one O
before O
i O
purchased O
. O

so O
i O
'm O
disappointed O
in O
that O
because O
communicating O
with O
my O
relatives O
out O
of O
the O
area O
is O
a O
priority O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
did O
n't O
learn O
in O
my O
research O
was O
the O
software O
i O
would O
need O
like O
privacy O
protection O
and O
warranty O
protection O
, O
in O
case O
it O
gets O
broken O
, O
or O
crashes O
etc O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
additional O
money O
right O
now O
, O
and O
therefore O
would O
n't O
have O
purchased O
it O
at O
this O
time O
. O

those O
things O
are O
very O
important O
- O
vital O
even O
! O

so O
think O
about O
factoring O
those O
things O
in O
when O
you O
purchase O
. O

i O
just O
hope O
the O
reputation O
that O
toshiba O
has O
is O
true O
and O
i O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
crash O
. O

i O
will O
have O
to O
purchase O
spy O
ware O
or O
nortell O
for O
privacy O
protection O
. O

thank O
you O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
emachines O
notebook O
pc O
in O
january O
of O
this O
year O
and O
i O
am O
highly O
dissatisfied O
with O
it O
. O

the O
internet O
explorer O
was O
very O
slow O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
. O

it O
freezes O
, O
and O
it O
always O
shows O
that O
there O
is O
an O
error O
, O
so O
i O
have O
to O
restart O
it O
a O
few O
times O
every O
time O
i O
use O
it O
. O

i O
tried O
to O
upgrade O
it O
to O
a O
newer O
version O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
and O
i O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

well O
, O
i O
started O
using O
google O
chrome O
, O
which O
is O
a O
little O
better O
, O
but O
it O
freezes O
too O
sometimes O
. O

this O
notebook O
restarts O
every O
time O
there O
is O
a O
new O
update O
, O
so O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
save O
your O
files O
and O
information O
, O
everything O
will O
be O
lost O
. O

another O
issue O
i O
have O
with O
it O
is O
the O
battery O
. O

maybe O
three O
or O
four O
months O
ago O
it O
started O
blinking O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
. O

there O
is O
a O
small O
red O
circle O
next O
to O
it O
with O
a O
x O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
and O
when O
i O
click O
on O
it O
it O
says O
: O
`` O
consider O
replacing O
your O
battery O
'' O
and O
it O
does O
not O
hold O
full O
charge O
. O

it O
is O
not O
even O
a O
year O
old O
yet O
, O
so O
i O
would O
definitely O
not O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
! O

this O
laptop O
is O
the O
most O
amazing O
little O
peice O
of O
machinery O
i O
have O
owned O
outside O
of O
the O
iphone O
. O

it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
top O
get O
away O
from O
the O
land O
of O
pcs O
, O
but O
now O
that O
i O
have O
, O
i O
ca O
n't O
see O
myself O
going O
back O
to O
it O
. O

the O
laptop O
is O
gorgeous O
. O

it O
is O
sleek O
, O
smooth O
, O
and O
lightweight O
. O

it O
is O
easily O
portable O
and O
i O
take O
it O
everywhere O
i O
go O
and O
might O
require O
internet O
access O
. O

the O
screen O
is O
very O
large O
and O
crystal O
clear O
with O
amazing O
colors O
and O
resolution O
. O

the O
keyboard O
is O
slick O
and O
quiet O
and O
not O
bulky O
like O
some O
other O
laptops O
i O
have O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

the O
processor O
is O
very O
quick O
and O
effective O
as O
i O
load O
webpages O
and O
applications O
. O

it O
is O
quiet O
and O
a O
real O
joy O
to O
watch O
work O
. O

i O
love O
it O
and O
will O
probably O
get O
another O
one O
when O
this O
goes O
to O
the O
laptop O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
! O

overall O
this O
laptop O
is O
great O
. O

it O
has O
plenty O
of O
memory O
, O
lots O
of O
hard O
drive O
, O
and O
great O
graphics O
. O

it O
runs O
very O
quiet O
too O
which O
is O
a O
plus O
. O

the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
they O
give O
you O
the O
worst O
batteries O
possible O
. O

they O
only O
stay O
charged O
a O
little O
over O
an O
hour O
. O

laptops O
are O
usually O
used O
on O
the O
go O
, O
so O
why O
not O
give O
you O
a O
better O
battery O
? O

this O
a O
starter O
notebook O
. O

the O
processor O
a O
amd O
semprom O
at O
2.1 O
ghz O
is O
a O
bummer O
it O
does O
not O
have O
the O
power O
for O
hd O
or O
heavy O
computing O
. O

the O
notebook O
is O
lacking O
a O
hdmi O
port O
and O
a O
s-video O
port O
that O
would O
enable O
one O
to O
hook O
it O
to O
a O
tv O
. O

if O
you O
check O
you O
will O
find O
the O
same O
notebook O
with O
the O
above O
missing O
ports O
and O
a O
dual O
core O
amd O
or O
intel O
processor O
. O

i O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
wanting O
a O
notebook O
expecting O
the O
performance O
of O
a O
desktop O
it O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations O
. O

it O
is O
a O
cheap O
throw O
together O
. O

save O
your O
money O
and O
go O
for O
a O
better O
device O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O
price O
and O
has O
a O
sleek O
look O
. O

runs O
smooth O
and O
quick O
. O

i O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
webcam O
though O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
! O

i O
love O
my O
new O
computer O
! O

its O
fast O
and O
another O
thing O
i O
like O
is O
that O
it O
has O
three O
usb O
ports O
. O

i O
love O
to O
write O
and O
play O
with O
graphics O
and O
html O
programming O
and O
my O
new O
toshiba O
works O
great O
on O
both O
! O

thank O
you O
for O
your O
great O
product O
! O

everything O
about O
this O
computer O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

wonderful O
features O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
battery O
wo O
n't O
last O
more O
than O
1 O
/ O
2 O
an O
hour O
. O

it O
discharges O
too O
quickly O
. O

kind O
of O
annoying O
, O
but O
i O
still O
love O
the O
laptop O
. O

it O
has O
good O
speed O
and O
plenty O
of O
hard O
drive O
space O
. O

the O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
volume O
control O
. O

the O
wheel O
that O
turns O
the O
volume O
up O
and O
down O
does O
n't O
work O
in O
real O
time O
. O

i O
have O
to O
keep O
turning O
it O
until O
it O
decides O
to O
lower O
and O
there O
is O
no O
mute O
. O

i O
bought O
my O
macbook O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
has O
been O
my O
baby O
ever O
since O
. O

i O
love O
it O
so O
much O
. O

it O
has O
come O
into O
good O
use O
for O
my O
finances O
, O
scheduling O
, O
my O
parents O
business O
expenses O
, O
and O
it O
is O
definitely O
amazing O
for O
gaming O
. O

the O
best O
thing O
is O
even O
while O
doing O
almost O
ten O
or O
twenty O
things O
at O
once O
, O
it O
never O
slows O
down O
. O

it O
's O
just O
as O
fast O
with O
one O
program O
open O
as O
it O
is O
with O
sixteen O
open O
. O

it O
works O
exactly O
like O
it O
did O
the O
day O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

great O
investment O
! O

i O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
while O
on O
a O
business O
trip O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
my O
email O
. O

i O
had O
left O
my O
regular O
laptop O
at O
home O
and O
needed O
something O
to O
use O
while O
out O
of O
town O
. O

the O
price O
and O
features O
more O
than O
met O
my O
needs O
. O

i O
love O
windows O
7 O
which O
is O
a O
vast O
improvment O
over O
vista O
. O

the O
feature O
are O
good O
enough O
for O
what O
i O
need O
. O

i O
love O
my O
macbook O
pro O
! O

i O
have O
been O
a O
mac O
user O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
. O

i O
grew O
up O
in O
a O
design O
family O
so O
it O
only O
made O
sense O
. O

my O
laptop O
is O
almost O
2yrs O
old O
and O
i O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

if O
you O
are O
a O
pc O
user O
looking O
to O
convert O
i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

it O
may O
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
or O
other O
headaches O
. O

not O
to O
mention O
the O
fact O
that O
your O
mac O
comes O
fully O
loaded O
with O
all O
necessary O
basic O
programs O
. O

i O
am O
addicted O
to O
photo O
booth O
! O

it O
is O
so O
much O
fun O
to O
play O
with O
. O

i O
work O
with O
kids O
and O
they O
love O
making O
short O
videos O
on O
there O
. O

i O
am O
able O
to O
organize O
my O
pics O
, O
music O
and O
files O
easily O
. O

if O
you O
have O
any O
creativity O
in O
you O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
get O
a O
mac O
! O

since O
i O
keyboard O
over O
100 O
wpm O
, O
i O
look O
for O
a O
unit O
that O
has O
a O
comfortble O
keyboard O
( O
no O
keys O
sticking O
or O
lagging O
, O
strange O
configuration O
of O
`` O
extra O
key O
'' O
, O
etc O
. O

i O
love O
the O
keyboard O
. O

most O
laptops O
and O
notebooks O
are O
difficult O
to O
key O
on O
. O

this O
unit O
is O
not O
. O

the O
display O
is O
awesome O
. O

the O
resolution O
is O
even O
higher O
then O
any O
other O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

only O
thing O
i O
would O
want O
to O
add O
to O
this O
is O
an O
internal O
bluray O
read O
/ O
write O
drive O
. O

but O
other O
than O
that O
i O
am O
blown O
away O
by O
all O
the O
features O
this O
laptop O
offers O
. O

i O
think O
this O
computer O
is O
super O
lame O
. O

i O
dont O
understand O
how O
anyone O
can O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
product O
worth O
purchasing O
. O

i O
went O
to O
my O
local O
best O
buy O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
since O
mine O
broke O
. O

i O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
pile O
of O
crap O
on O
a O
whim O
and O
totally O
freaking O
regret O
it O
. O

it O
doesnt O
work O
worth O
a O
damn O
. O

the O
display O
is O
beyond O
horrible O
. O

i O
can O
not O
even O
read O
what O
i O
am O
writing O
half O
of O
the O
time O
. O

there O
are O
so O
many O
things O
wrong O
with O
this O
product O
, O
it O
just O
makes O
me O
want O
to O
set O
my O
self O
on O
fire O
! O

i O
would O
totally O
recommend O
any O
other O
laptop O
over O
this O
pile O
of O
grabage O
. O

i O
know O
there O
are O
way O
better O
laptops O
out O
there O
for O
the O
same O
price O
, O
and O
why O
spend O
money O
on O
shit O
when O
you O
can O
go O
out O
and O
get O
yourself O
a O
perfectly O
decent O
laptop O
that O
doesnt O
suck O
total O
monkey O
balls O
. O

not O
to O
mention O
it O
has O
shit O
gigs O
. O

i O
could O
not O
even O
put O
my O
entire O
music O
collection O
on O
this O
garabage O
. O

do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
invest O
in O
a O
few O
external O
harddrives O
if O
you O
are O
planning O
on O
purchasing O
this O
laptop O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
last O
week O
, O
and O
the O
very O
next O
day O
had O
to O
return O
it O
because O
it O
over O
heated O
and O
the O
touch-mouse O
stopped O
responding O
. O

got O
another O
1 O
, O
and O
same O
issue O
. O

i O
am O
taking O
back O
today O
. O

do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
or O
time O
. O

very O
dissappointed O
becase O
i O
have O
had O
toshibas O
for O
years O
, O
and O
never O
a O
issue O
. O

stopped O
booting O
up O
less O
than O
a O
week O
after O
my O
one-year O
warranty O
was O
up O
. O

toshiba O
knows O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
but O
will O
not O
acknowledge O
it O
. O

summary O
: O
after O
doing O
some O
investigation O
on O
the O
web O
, O
i O
have O
found O
that O
toshiba O
nb205s O
are O
not O
chronically O
not O
booting O
. O

apparently O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
, O
something O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
thermal O
paste O
. O

toshiba O
will O
not O
acknowledge O
this O
problem O
. O

when O
i O
called O
toshiba O
, O
they O
would O
not O
do O
anything O
and O
even O
tried O
to O
charge O
me O
$ O
35 O
for O
the O
phone O
call O
, O
even O
though O
they O
did O
n't O
offer O
any O
technical O
support O
. O

i O
loved O
the O
netbook O
( O
minus O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
windows O
os O
) O
until O
this O
started O
happening O
. O

but O
if O
you O
ca O
n't O
make O
your O
product O
last O
more O
than O
a O
year O
, O
you O
will O
not O
get O
my O
business O
again O
. O

i O
've O
had O
my O
macbook O
pro O
for O
three O
years O
now O
and O
still O
love O
it O
! O

in O
those O
three O
years O
, O
i O
've O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
minor O
problems O
and O
both O
were O
resolved O
by O
apple O
quickly O
and O
easily O
. O

my O
power O
supply O
cord O
developed O
exposed O
wires O
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
ownership O
, O
so O
it O
was O
covered O
by O
the O
applecare O
warranty O
plan O
. O

after O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
, O
my O
battery O
life O
began O
to O
diminish O
but O
was O
replaced O
for O
free O
due O
to O
a O
company-wide O
recall O
of O
my O
particular O
battery O
. O

in O
the O
three O
years O
i O
've O
had O
my O
macbook O
pro O
, O
i O
have O
never O
had O
a O
virus O
on O
my O
computer O
, O
and O
i O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

while O
there O
are O
occasions O
that O
my O
computer O
will O
freeze O
or O
will O
need O
to O
be O
manually O
shut O
down O
, O
this O
occurs O
far O
less O
frequently O
than O
on O
pc O
computers O
and O
laptops O
that O
i O
've O
used O
. O

the O
ilife O
software O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
computer O
is O
so O
simple O
to O
use O
and O
produces O
a O
great O
finished O
product O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
! O

it O
absolutely O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
most O
pc O
laptops O
, O
but O
the O
ease O
of O
use O
, O
security O
, O
and O
minimal O
problems O
that O
have O
arisen O
make O
it O
well O
worth O
the O
pricetag O
. O

needs O
constant O
repair O
. O

first O
the O
screen O
goes O
completely O
out O
. O

then O
hp O
sends O
it O
back O
to O
me O
with O
the O
hardware O
screwed O
up O
, O
not O
able O
to O
connect O
. O

now O
the O
screen O
is O
going O
darker O
, O
darker O
, O
darker O
. O

hp O
is O
more O
interested O
in O
selling O
extended O
warranties O
( O
which O
cost O
more O
than O
the O
netbook O
new O
) O
then O
they O
are O
in O
helping O
or O
fixing O
. O

oh O
yeah O
, O
do O
n't O
forget O
the O
expensive O
shipping O
to O
and O
from O
hp O
. O

i'v O
spent O
as O
much O
for O
shipping O
as O
i O
would O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
netbook O
-- O
of O
course O
a O
different O
brand O
. O

so O
far O
so O
good O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

fan O
vents O
to O
the O
side O
, O
so O
no O
cooling O
pad O
needed O
, O
great O
feature O
! O

screen O
is O
crystal O
clear O
and O
the O
system O
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

memory O
is O
upgradable O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
would O
change O
about O
it O
is O
the O
mouse O
keys O
. O

they O
click O
. O

sounds O
like O
a O
typewriter O
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
get O
past O
that O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
for O
a O
little O
money O
! O

i O
have O
owned O
many O
computers O
and O
laptops O
. O

i O
hate O
this O
one O
. O

vista O
is O
a O
nightmare O
. O

no O
tutorials O
on O
the O
display O
. O

the O
book O
is O
useless O
. O

the O
machine O
has O
a O
bluray O
player O
the O
book O
has O
no O
mention O
of O
it O
or O
how O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
your O
hdtv O
. O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
i O
purchased O
it O
. O

thinking O
about O
returning O
it O

the O
macbook O
is O
a O
fantastic O
laptop O
. O

this O
is O
the O
first O
macbook O
i O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

i O
came O
from O
the O
dell O
laptops O
and O
now O
i O
am O
so O
glad O
i O
switched O
when O
i O
needed O
a O
new O
laptop O
. O

the O
macbooks O
are O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
very O
portable O
yet O
hold O
tons O
of O
information O
and O
performance O
. O

although O
the O
price O
is O
higher O
then O
dell O
laptops O
, O
the O
macbooks O
are O
worth O
the O
dough O
. O

you O
will O
love O
this O
macbook O
if O
you O
choose O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

the O
macbook O
rarely O
requires O
a O
hard O
reboot O
. O

it O
just O
works O
flawlessly O
! O

its O
hard O
to O
encounter O
a O
problem O
on O
a O
mac O
that O
would O
require O
such O
abrupt O
action O
. O

dells O
are O
ok O
, O
hps O
are O
n't O
that O
good O
, O
but O
macs O
or O
fantastic O
. O

i O
honestly O
love O
my O
mac O
, O
thats O
why O
i O
am O
a O
self O
proclaimed O
mac O
addict O
. O

if O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O
macs O
i O
suggest O
going O
to O
apple.com O
and O
heading O
towards O
the O
macbook O
page O
for O
more O
information O
on O
the O
applications O
. O

this O
was O
purchased O
for O
my O
daughter O
and O
i O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

i O
was O
n't O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
netbooks O
but O
this O
one O
was O
very O
well O
designed O
. O

it O
had O
the O
full O
sized O
touch O
pad O
with O
2 O
buttons O
instead O
of O
just O
one O
. O

it O
made O
the O
computer O
much O
easier O
to O
use O
and O
navigate O
. O

keyboard O
was O
also O
very O
nice O
and O
had O
a O
solid O
feel O
. O

this O
system O
came O
loaded O
with O
windows O
7 O
starter O
. O

while O
lacking O
some O
of O
the O
functions O
of O
the O
other O
versions O
, O
this O
was O
very O
acceptable O
for O
the O
uses O
planned O
for O
this O
computer O
. O

so O
far O
, O
so O
good O
. O

when O
i O
got O
this O
laptop O
in O
2007 O
to O
help O
me O
with O
school O
, O
i O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
from O
beginning O
. O

i O
feel O
that O
it O
was O
poorly O
put O
together O
, O
because O
once O
in O
a O
while O
different O
plastic O
pieces O
would O
come O
off O
of O
it O
. O

quite O
simply O
this O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

i O
have O
had O
several O
machines O
over O
the O
years O
, O
both O
for O
personal O
and O
business O
use O
. O

all O
of O
them O
were O
windows O
machines O
. O

do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
i O
am O
no O
microsoft O
hater O
, O
i O
've O
just O
managed O
to O
turn O
into O
a O
much O
bigger O
apple O
fan O
because O
of O
this O
machine O
. O

for O
me O
, O
five O
stars O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

i O
love O
the O
15 O
'' O
macbook O
pro O
. O

my O
parents O
bought O
it O
for O
me O
as O
a O
graduation O
gift O
, O
and O
i O
'm O
totally O
( O
almost O
kind O
of O
maybe O
definitely O
) O
obsessed O
with O
it O
. O

it O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
just O
pick O
up O
and O
use O
-- O

it O
did O
not O
take O
long O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
mac O
os O
. O

( O
i O
had O
been O
a O
windows/linux O
user O
before O
this O
) O

i O
love O
the O
size O
because O
the O
screen O
is O
big O
enough O
for O
what O
i O
use O
it O
for O
( O
internet O
, O
artwork O
) O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
reasonably O
portable O
. O

there O
are O
several O
programs O
for O
school O
or O
office O
use O
( O
pages O
, O
numbers O
, O
keynote O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
, O
music O
( O
garageband O
) O
, O
photo O
management O
( O
photo O
booth O
, O
iphoto O
) O
, O
video-editing O
or O
movie-making O
( O
imovie O
) O
, O
etc O
. O

the O
built-in O
webcam O
is O
great O
for O
skype O
and O
similar O
video-chat O
services O
. O

itunes O
is O
a O
handy O
music-management O
program O
, O
and O
it O
is O
essential O
for O
anyone O
with O
an O
ipod O
. O

the O
neat O
and O
organized O
icon O
list O
is O
a O
welcome O
change O
from O
cluttered O
and O
confusing O
desktop O
icons O
. O

all-in-all O
, O
i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
product O
for O
nearly O
everyone O
. O

i O
've O
always O
owned O
a O
pc O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
macbook O
to O
see O
what O
it O
's O
all O
about O
. O

i O
love O
it O
! O

i O
'm O
so O
glad O
i O
purchased O
a O
mac O
and O
not O
another O
pc O
! O
! O
! O

they O
definitely O
have O
a O
superior O
product O
! O

its O
not O
just O
slow O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
its O
slow O
in O
general O
. O

no O
i O
am O
generous O
calling O
it O
slow O
. O

its O
more O
like O
a O
snail O
crawl O
. O

i O
bought O
for O
my O
son O
in O
the O
2nd O
grade O
. O

he O
ca O
n't O
stand O
it O
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
begin O
to O
say O
how O
disappointed O
i O
am O
. O

i O
should O
have O
spent O
an O
extra O
hundred O
bucks O
and O
got O
a O
full O
sized O
computer O
. O

the O
key O
bindings O
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
, O
but O
have O
loved O
the O
macbook O
pro O
. O

delivery O
was O
early O
too O
. O

it O
allows O
me O
to O
do O
everything O
i O
need O
from O
a O
computer O
and O
more O
. O

with O
awesome O
graphics O
and O
assuring O
security O
, O
it O
's O
perfect O
! O

the O
difference O
in O
the O
apple O
keyboard O
from O
a O
pc O
's O
keyboard O
took O
a O
bit O
of O
tim O
to O
get O
used O
to O
, O
but O
overall O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
! O

i O
'd O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anyone O
! O

the O
toshiba O
satellite O
laptop O
is O
designed O
to O
fail O
! O

the O
board O
has O
a O
bad O
connector O
with O
the O
power O
supply O
and O
shortly O
after O
warrenty O
expires O
the O
power O
supply O
will O
start O
having O
issues O
. O

toshiba O
is O
aware O
of O
the O
issue O
but O
unless O
the O
extended O
warrenty O
is O
bought O
toshiba O
will O
do O
nothing O
about O
it O
. O

i O
actually O
contact O
toshiba O
before O
i O
started O
having O
problem O
and O
was O
given O
run O
around O
after O
i O
supplied O
serial O
number O
in O
order O
to O
delay O
me O
sending O
in O
laptop O
until O
after O
warrenty O
expired O
. O

then O
after O
paying O
for O
it O
to O
be O
examined O
i O
was O
told O
it O
was O
same O
problem O
cited O
on O
website O
but O
i O
'd O
have O
to O
pay O
anyways O
since O
it O
was O
past O
warrenty O
. O

it O
has O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
for O
power O
, O
storage O
, O
and O
abilitiy O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
navigate O
and O
update O
programs O
. O

my O
kids O
have O
to O
take O
their O
pcs O
in O
once O
a O
year O
to O
have O
them O
`` O
de-bugged O
'' O
. O

i O
've O
never O
had O
problems O
with O
viruses O
. O

my O
next O
laptop O
will O
also O
be O
a O
mac O
! O

i O
would O
like O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
best O
laptop O
i O
just O
got O
from O
mac O
. O

i O
work O
in O
film O
editing O
and O
post O
production O
, O
so O
i O
need O
a O
laptop O
that O
not O
only O
has O
power O
, O
but O
memory O
and O
speed O
as O
well O
. O

my O
mac O
laptop O
is O
fabulous O
in O
both O
areas O
. O

it O
gives O
me O
the O
power O
and O
speed O
that O
i O
need O
to O
run O
all O
the O
programs O
i O
use O
to O
edit O
. O

the O
final O
cut O
pro O
on O
this O
laptop O
is O
so O
fast O
and O
easy O
, O
and O
i O
can O
use O
this O
to O
seemlessly O
transfer O
all O
my O
work O
to O
my O
home O
computer O
, O
which O
is O
also O
a O
mac O
. O

i O
would O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
for O
every O
person O
in O
my O
office O
if O
i O
could O
. O

in O
my O
line O
of O
work O
, O
i O
often O
have O
to O
take O
work O
home O
, O
and O
this O
makes O
it O
so O
easy O
. O

i O
do O
transcription O
work O
on O
the O
side O
, O
and O
the O
flatline O
keyboard O
makes O
typing O
quick O
and O
easy O
as O
well O
. O

the O
apple O
care O
has O
never O
failed O
me O
, O
and O
i O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
the O
same O
for O
this O
computer O
as O
well O
. O

i O
will O
only O
buy O
apple O
laptops O
from O
now O
on O
. O

great O
laptop O
for O
school O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
for O
beginners O
in O
the O
household O
. O

keyboard O
is O
great O
but O
primary O
and O
secondary O
control O
buttons O
could O
be O
more O
durable O
. O

battery O
life O
could O
be O
better O
but O
overall O
for O
the O
price O
and O
toshiba O
's O
reputation O
for O
laptops O
it O
's O
great O
! O

my O
macbook O
pro O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

from O
the O
build O
quality O
to O
the O
performance O
, O
everything O
about O
it O
has O
been O
sub-par O
from O
what O
i O
would O
have O
expected O
from O
apple O
. O

the O
system O
constantly O
overheats O
, O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
too O
short O
, O
the O
case O
is O
coming O
apart O
, O
and O
my O
core O
applications O
that O
i O
use O
every O
day O
in O
my O
work O
as O
a O
graphic O
artist O
run O
poorly O
. O

i O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
. O

screen O
is O
awesome O
, O
battery O
life O
is O
good O
. O

really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface O
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
. O

good O
laptop O
for O
the O
money O
. O

speakers O
do O
n't O
get O
that O
loud O
, O
but O
good O
enough O
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
ever O
buying O
a O
pc O
again O
! O

i O
have O
had O
a O
mac O
for O
6 O
years O
and O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
to O
pc O
. O

they O
do O
n't O
crash O
. O

if O
a O
website O
ever O
freezes O
( O
which O
is O
rare O
) O
, O
its O
really O
easy O
to O
force O
quit O
. O

never O
been O

had O
to O
call O

a O
few O
questions O
or O
issues O
and O
they O
have O
helped O
me O
for O
free O
, O
even O
without O
the O
warranty O
. O

a O
mac O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
it O
simply O
makes O
sense O
. O

its O
also O
fun O
to O
use O
! O

the O
programs O
are O
great O
, O
like O
iphoto O
( O
love O
the O
editing O
capabilities O
) O
, O
imail O
( O
which O
can O
incorporate O
with O
the O
address O
book O
on O
the O
ipod O
and O

) O
, O
imovie O

my O
sister O

the O
same O
mac O
as O

and O
she O
is O
in O
a O
band O
and O
uses O
garageband O

edit O
. O

she O
said O
its O
very O
user O
friendly O
. O

i O
have O
had O
another O
mac O
, O
but O
it O
got O
slow O
due O
to O
an O
older O
operating O
system O
. O

however O
, O
i O
love O
this O
particular O
mac O
because O
its O
very O
fast O
, O
great O
size O
, O
and O
has O
fantastic O
features O
like O
the O
lighted O
keyboard O
and O
easy O
mouse O
pad O
. O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
i O
bought O
this O
mac O
, O
well O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

i O
simply O
got O
tired O
of O
a O
bad O
computer O
like O
windows O
with O
its O
constant O
freezing O
and O
anti-virus O
. O

i O
got O
my O
macbook O
pro O
because O
i O
wanted O
to O
do O
all O
the O
stuff O
i O
need O
to O
do O
without O
worrying O
about O
the O
system O
quitting O
on O
me O
or O
freezing O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

now O
that O
i O
have O
it O
i O
see O
that O
i O
really O
needed O
this O
for O
much O
more O
. O

i O
run O
dreamweaver O
, O
final O
cut O
pro O
7 O
, O
photoshop O
, O
safari O
, O
firefox O
, O
msn O
messenger O
and O
a O
few O
other O
applications O
constantly O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

i O
have O
not O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
applications O
quitting O
or O
freezing O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anybody O
that O
wants O
great O
performance O
from O
a O
laptop O
and O
would O
like O
to O
relax O
and O
not O
become O
enraged O
cursing O
the O
gods O
about O
to O
throw O
your O
laptop O
out O
the O
door O
. O

take O
the O
simple O
, O
easy O
solution O
to O
your O
computer O
problems O
and O
stop O
waiting O
and O
smacking O
your O
old O
computer O
around O
. O

i O
've O
had O
my O
macbook O
pro O
since O
august O
2009 O
. O

prior O
to O
this O
computer O
, O
i O
owned O
a O
powerbook O
g4 O
for O
6 O
years O
( O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
for O
a O
laptop O
) O
. O

that O
was O
my O
first O
apple O
product O
and O
since O
then O
i O
have O
been O
incredibly O
happy O
with O
every O
product O
of O
theirs O
i O
have O
bought O
. O

my O
macbook O
pro O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

on O
my O
powerbook O
g4 O
i O
would O
never O
use O
the O
trackpad O
i O
would O
use O
an O
external O
mouse O
because O
i O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
trackpad O
. O

since O
i O
've O
had O
this O
computer O
i O
've O
only O
used O
the O
trackpad O
because O
it O
is O
so O
nice O
and O
smooth O
. O

i O
also O
like O
that O
you O
can O
scroll O
down O
in O
a O
window O
using O
two O
fingers O
on O
the O
trackpad O
. O

the O
display O
is O
incredibly O
bright O
, O
much O
brighter O
than O
my O
powerbook O
and O
very O
crisp O
. O

the O
computer O
runs O
very O
fast O
with O
no O
problems O
and O
the O
ilife O
software O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
( O
iphoto O
, O
imovie O
, O
iweb O
, O
itunes O
, O
garageband O
) O
is O
all O
very O
helpful O
as O
well O
. O

i O
also O
purchased O
iwork O
to O
go O
with O
it O
which O
has O
programs O
for O
word O
processing O
, O
spreadsheets O
, O
and O
presentations O
( O
similar O
to O
microsoft O
office O
) O
. O

i O
like O
those O
programs O
better O
than O
office O
and O
you O
can O
save O
your O
files O
to O
be O
completely O
compatible O
with O
the O
office O
programs O
as O
well O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
get O
a O
new O
laptop O
who O
is O
willing O
to O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
money O
to O
get O
great O
quality O
! O

shiny O

this O
laptop O
is O
the O
best O
of O
the O
best O
! O

the O
awesomest O
of O
the O
awesomest O
. O

it O
is O
so O
great O
, O
i O
can O
hardly O
ever O
take O
my O
hands O
off O
it O
! O

my O
friends O
are O
in O
awe O
every O
time O
they O
come O
over O
! O

i O
got O
it O
for O
christmas O
, O
and O
i O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
set O
it O
up O
! O

it O
is O
super O
fast O
, O
and O
always O
loads O
. O

i O
am O
just O
amazed O
. O

the O
only O
bad O
part O
is O
the O
size O
/ O
weight O
. O

it O
's O
like O
9 O
punds O
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
look O
past O
it O
, O
it O
's O
great O
! O

if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
fingerprints O
, O
this O
might O
not O
be O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
. O

it O
super O
shiny O
, O
so O
you O
can O
see O
the O
fingerprints O
easily O
. O

it O
does O
n't O
bother O
me O
though O
. O

it O
does O
n't O
heat O
up O
like O
my O
old O
laptop O
. O

all O
for O
such O
a O
great O
price O
. O

it O
's O
color O
is O
even O
cool O
. O

another O
great O
thing O
is O
the O
beast O
graphics O
. O

they O
are O
so O
realistic O
i O
am O
just O
speechless O
. O

i O
let O
my O
friend O
borrow O
it O
, O
and O
she O
knows O
nothing O
about O
computers O
, O
and O
she O
used O
it O
with O
ease O
. O

the O
cool O
thing O
about O
this O
is O
anyone O
can O
use O
it O
. O

mom O
, O
dad O
, O
brother O
, O
sister O
, O
you O
name O
it O
! O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
i O
could O
ever O
live O
without O
my O
qousmio O
. O

i O
own O
a O
hewlett O
packard O
laptop O
and O
i O
've O
had O
man O
problems O
with O
it O
since O
i O
bought O
in O
in O
feb O
, O
201 O

ive O
had O
to O
call O
tech O
support O
many O
times O
. O

each O
time O
taking O
about O
1 O
day O
or O
so O
. O

i O
just O
recently O
had O
to O
ship O
my O
laptop O
back O
to O
hp O
for O
repair O
. O

i O
had O
to O
wait O
3 O
weeks O
to O
get O
it O
back O
and O
it O
still O
is O
not O
working O
properly O
. O

i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
shipping O
! O

i O
will O
never O
buy O
anything O
from O
hp O
again O
! O

one O
of O
the O
smartest O
thing O
i O
did O
was O
take O
my O
time O
to O
compare O
laptops O
before O
making O
my O
purchase O
. O

the O
toshiba O
satellite O
has O
been O
more O
than O
i O
expected O
for O
the O
price O
. O

i O
will O
stack O
it O
up O
against O
laptops O
that O
cost O
twice O
as O
much O
any O
day O
. O

this O
computer O
may O
be O
small O
but O
it O
is O
one O
heck O
of O
a O
power O
horse O
. O

you O
can O
do O
it O
all O
on O
this O
bad O
boy O
but O
the O
main O
thing O
this O
netbook O
was O
desinged O
for O
was O
surfing O
the O
web O
and O
boy O
o O
boy O
does O
it O
ever O
. O

for O
being O
so O
small O
it O
is O
amazing O
that O
it O
is O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
is O
. O

when O
i O
first O
got O
it O
i O
thought O
the O
size O
of O
it O
was O
a O
joke O
. O

but O
after O
i O
got O
used O
to O
it O
i O
love O
it O
. O

the O
size O
of O
has O
actually O
help O
me O
out O
quite O
a O
bit O
by O
me O
being O
able O
to O
fit O
it O
in O
an O
already O
full O
backpack O
and O
to O
use O
it O
at O
a O
resturant O
where O
the O
food O
on O
the O
table O
is O
always O
so O
space O
consuming O
. O

it O
has O
3 O
usb O
ports O
, O
1 O
sd O
memory O
card O
reader O
and O
an O
sd O
memory O
car O
expansion O
. O

the O
only O
down O
fall O
is O
that O
it O
has O
no O
cd O
drive O
but O
i O
found O
that O
they O
are O
very O
cheap O
to O
by O
and O
also O
very O
portable O
making O
this O
the O
best O
friend O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
always O
looking O
for O
more O
space O
then O
they O
have O
. O

overall O
i O
would O
recomend O
this O
to O
anybody O
and O
tell O
them O
that O
if O
they O
want O
to O
burn O
their O
music O
or O
play O
there O
video O
games O
to O
buy O
the O
cd O
drive O
. O

i O
would O
never O
go O
back O
any O
more O
, O
i O
love O
this O
computer O
so O
much O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
. O

i O
use O
my O
mac O
all O
the O
time O
, O
i O
love O
the O
software O
, O
the O
way O
it O
takes O
a O
short O
time O
to O
load O
things O
, O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
use O
and O
most O
of O
all O
how O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
. O

with O
a O
mac O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
antivirus O
software O
or O
firewall O
, O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O
. O

this O
computer O
is O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
any O
pc O
but O
it O
will O
last O
you O
longer O
and O
it O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

all O
apple O
associates O
are O
always O
wiling O
to O
help O
you O
out O
with O
anything O
, O
no O
matter O
when O
you O
purchased O
the O
computer O
and O
how O
many O
years O
passed O
. O

this O
computer O
will O
last O
you O
at O
least O
7 O
years O
, O
thats O
an O
amazing O
life O
spanned O
an O
electronic O
. O

everything O
about O
a O
mac O
is O
wonderful O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
little O
used O
to O
learning O
and O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
new O
system O
, O
but O
you O
will O
learn O
fast O
and O
its O
all O
worth O
it O
. O

this O
company O
truely O
does O
make O
horrible O
products O
and O
doesnt O
seem O
to O
because O
they O
are O
certain O
things O
like O
this O
`` O

... O

do O
a O
quick O
search O
on O

only O
one O
. O

i O
'm O
new O
- O
just O
switched O
from O
years O
of O
pc O
frustration O
. O

what O
an O
elegant O
, O
wonderful O
machine O
. O

i O
'm O
making O
the O
switch O
and O
finding O
that O
my O
biggest O
problem O
is O
trying O
to O
do O
things O
the O
'old O
' O
way O
- O
and O
apple O
does O
, O
indeed O
, O
have O
the O
better O
idea O
. O

i O
really O
wish O
i O
had O
done O
this O
years O
ago O
. O

pairing O
it O
with O
an O
iphone O
is O
a O
pure O
pleasure O
- O
talk O
about O
painless O
syncing O
- O
used O
to O
take O
me O
forever O
- O
now O
it O
's O
a O
snap O
. O

thank O
you O
best O
buy O
for O
putting O
my O
computer O
together O
and O
installing O
my O
first O
software O
- O
you O
guys O
were O
great O
too O
! O

i O
love O
it O
- O
never O
had O
a O
computer O
i O
was O
so O
impressed O
with O
- O
and O
i O
've O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
- O
this O
one O
is O
far O
and O
above O
the O
best O
one O
i O
ever O
had O
before O
. O

i O
tell O
everyone O
that O
i O
know O
, O
friends O
, O
family O
and O
enemies O
this O
is O
the O
absolute O
worst O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O
. O

the O
computer O
blinks O
it O
shuts O
off O
at O
will O
. O

the O
letter O
a O
stopped O
working O
after O
the O
first O
week O
. O

when O
i O
called O
to O
have O
another O
one O
shipped O
or O
to O
get O
my O
money O
back O
they O
said O
the O
return O
policy O
is O
23 O
twenty O
three O
days O
from O
the O
date O
of O
purchase O
. O

not O
the O
day O
received O
. O

so O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
work O
on O
the O
24 O
twenty O
fourth O
day O
is O
my O
fault O
. O

they O
have O
done O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
fix O
the O
computer O
problem O
. O

they O
have O
not O
sent O
a O
new O
one O
nor O
called O
. O

i O
spent O
eight O
hundred O
dollars O
from O
a O
giant O
paper O
weight O
that O
looks O
good O
on O
a O
bus O
. O

then O
on O
top O
of O
it O
all O
their O
cusromer O
service O
center O
is O
in O
the O
middle O
east O
. O

so O
when O
you O
do O
call O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
hunk O
of O
metal O
you O
get O
the O
joy O
of O
speaking O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
people O
you O
cant O
understand O
. O

then O
to O
make O
matters O
worst O
, O
there O
is O
noone O
that O
they O
can O
transfer O
you O
to O
. O

its O
sad O
because O
their O
commercials O
are O
great O
. O

i O
had O
this O
computer O
for O
one O
month O
and O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
repair O
. O

got O
the O
computer O
back O
a O
month O
later O
and O
it O
was O
still O
broken O
sent O
it O
out O
again O
and O
they O
repaired O
it O
. O

3 O
weeks O
went O
by O
and O
the O
computer O
keeps O
crashing O
and O
will O
not O
open O
any O
applications O
. O

do O
not O
buy O
gateway O
computers O
they O
are O
junk O
and O
the O
warranty O
company O
is O
horrible O
. O

you O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
to O
an O
american O
warranty O
service O
is O
out O
of O
country O
. O

computer O
has O
been O
at O
service O
facility O
more O
than O
in O
my O
hands O
. O

i O
have O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
i O
would O
say O
im O
pretty O
satisfied O
. O

the O
only O
problems O
are O
the O
sound O
isnt O
very O
loud O
i O
have O
to O
wear O
headphones O
. O

another O
thing O
is O
that O
after O
only O
a O
month O
the O
left O
mouse O
key O
broke O
and O
it O
costed O
$ O
175 O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

that O
whole O
experience O
was O
just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse O
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
$ O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O
. O

it O
took O
a O
little O
over O
2 O
weeks O
until O
i O
got O
it O
back O
. O

and O
i O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
just O
one O
day O
when O
i O
opened O
it O
turned O
it O
on O
went O
to O
click O
and O
it O
was O
broke O
. O

i O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
and O
i O
still O
do O
. O

to O
be O
honest O
i O
think O
it O
was O
faulty O
equipment O
or O
something O
but O
idk O
. O

the O
graphics O
are O
great O
. O

the O
internet O
speed O
is O
spectacular O
. O

the O
battery O
life O
is O
probably O
an O
hour O
at O
best O
. O

oh O
and O
it O
has O
word O
and O
stuff O
but O
its O
a O
trial O
verion O
so O
after O
about O
a O
month O
or O
so O
when O
you O
go O
to O
open O
it O
it O
asks O
for O
a O
product O
key O
which O
didnt O
come O
with O
the O
computer O
and O
even O
after O
clicking O
cancel O
it O
wont O
let O
you O
use O
it O
at O
all O
i O
use O
the O
old O
word O
processer O
which O
works O
good O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
it O
just O
because O
of O
the O
internet O
speed O
probably O
because O
thats O
the O
only O
thing O
i O
really O
care O
about O
. O

i O
wish O
the O
volume O
could O
be O
louder O
and O
the O
mouse O
didnt O
break O
after O
only O
a O
month O
. O

i O
received O
this O
laptop O
as O
a O
gift O
and O
let O
me O
just O
tell O
you O
that O
its O
the O
worst O
. O

at O
first O
it O
worked O
well O
for O
a O
month O
or O
so O
then O
the O
system O
board O
failed O
and O
i O
send O
it O
in O
to O
toshiba O
some O
complaints O
and O
three O
weeks O
later O
i O
then O
receive O
my O
laptop O
back O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
it O
still O
has O
the O
same O
problem O
so O
now O
i O
have O
to O
send O
it O
back O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
again O
. O

this O
computer O
does O
n't O
do O
that O
well O
with O
certain O
games O
it O
ca O
n't O
play O
some O
and O
it O
becomes O
too O
hot O
while O
playing O
games O
. O

oh O
and O
if O
thats O
not O
bad O
enough O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
a O
recovery O
cd O
so O
you O
can O
make O
one O
if O
you O
know O
how O
to O
or O
buy O
one O
if O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
cost O
is O
$ O
25 O
for O
two O
cds O
. O

the O
whole O
experiece O
is O
horrible O
so O
save O
up O
and O
buy O
a O
better O
laptop O
. O

i O
bought O
a O
hp O
pavilion O
dv4-1222nr O
laptop O
and O
have O
had O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

the O
computer O
is O
so O
slow O
, O
even O
after O
paying O
staples O
the O
extra O
money O
to O
speed O
it O
up O
. O

they O
said O
it O
was O
a O
computer O
error O
on O
this O
type O
of O
computer O
. O

also O
, O
i O
have O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
it O
getting O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
not O
even O
sitting O
on O
anything O
to O
make O
it O
hot O
. O

when O
the O
computer O
has O
been O
on O
for O
several O
minutes O
, O
it O
will O
occasionaly O
just O
go O
off O
by O
itself O
. O

also O
, O
the O
battery O
does O
not O
last O
very O
long O
at O
all O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
not O
buying O
this O
product O
. O

i O
have O
had O
no O
luck O
with O
staples O
or O
hp O
to O
resolve O
this O
problem O
. O

i O
am O
stuck O
with O
a O
laptop O
that O
i O
can O
not O
do O
very O
much O
with O
. O

also O
, O
i O
have O
had O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
the O
keys O
sticking O
and O
will O
not O
type O
correctly O
. O

also O
, O
i O
have O
had O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
the O
shift O
key O
to O
go O
to O
other O
lines O
. O

it O
gets O
stuck O
all O
of O
the O
time O
you O
use O
it O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
keep O
tapping O
on O
it O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work O
. O

sometimes O
the O
screen O
even O
goes O
black O
on O
this O
computer O
. O

will O
probably O
never O
buy O
a O
hp O
again O
. O

purchased O
a O
toshiba O
lap O
top O
it O
worked O
good O
until O
just O
after O
the O
warrenty O
went O
out O
. O

after O
the O
warrenty O
expired O
the O
hard O
drive O
went O
bad O
and O
it O
would O
have O
cost O
more O
to O
fix O
then O
to O
replace O
. O

before O
we O
got O
this O
laptop O
, O
had O
a O
compaq O
pasaro O
for O
5 O
years O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

after O
the O
bad O
experience O
with O
this O
computer O
went O
back O
to O
compaq O
. O

i O
hate O
it O
. O

i O
have O
had O
the O
luxury O
( O
sarcasm O
) O
of O
owning O
2 O
of O
these O
laptops O
. O

the O
first O
fell O
apart O
right O
after O
the O
1-year-warranty O
. O

during O
that O
time O
, O
i O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
3 O
times O
. O

i O
paid O
about O
18000 O
for O
this O
laptop O
because O
of O
all O
the O
bells O
and O
whistles O
and O
it O
kept O
crapping O
out O
on O
me O
. O

none O
of O
the O
techs O
at O
hp O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

they O
would O
repair O
one O
thing O
, O
send O
it O
back O
and O
it O
would O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

the O
processor O
went O
on O
me O
, O
the O
fan O
went O
and O
the O
motherboard O
went O
. O

i O
wanted O
to O
purchase O
the O
extended O
warranty O
and O
they O
refused O
, O
because O
they O
knew O
it O
was O
trouble O
. O

i O
had O
something O
else O
go O
wrong O
and O
they O
said O
it O
had O
to O
be O
in O
good O
working O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
the O
warranty O
. O

i O
took O
it O
to O
friend O
who O
temporarily O
fixed O
it O
and O
i O
finally O
paid O
about O
1500 O
for O
the O
extended O
warranty O
. O

i O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
they O
lost O
it O
. O

i O
waited O
and O
waited O
and O
no O
laptop O
. O

finally O
after O
months O
of O
research O
the O
discovered O
that O
they O
mailed O
it O
to O
a O
walmart O
and O
there O
probably O
would O
be O
no O
way O
to O
find O
the O
box O
. O

i O
waited O
another O
month O
for O
approval O
and O
for O
them O
to O
`` O
build O
'' O
me O
a O
new O
laptop O
. O

i O
was O
psyched O
. O

i O
thought O
all O
my O
problems O
would O
finally O
be O
solved O
being O
that O
my O
old O
computer O
would O
n't O
go O
onto O
our O
wireless O
network O
and O
i O
would O
n't O
have O
the O
same O
problems O
because O
it O
was O
updated O
. O

here O
we O
are O
another O
year O
later O
and O
the O
computer O
is O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

hp O
did O
n't O
fix O
it O
. O

i O
swear O
they O
design O
these O
things O
to O
go O
to O
crap O
after O
a O
year O
so O
you O
are O
stuck O
and O
have O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
one O
. O

i O
use O
my O
friends O
and O
family O
's O
$ O
2000 O
laptops O
and O
they O
are O
fast O
and O
reliable O
and O
hp O
, O
well O
, O
i O
'll O
never O
buy O
or O
recommend O
an O
hp O
to O
anyone O
! O

bought O
notebook O
07/2009 O
. O

in O
5 O
months O
the O
connect O
quality O
got O
worse O
and O
worse O
. O

1st O
time O
they O
got O
it O
working O
the O
next O
5 O
month O
they O
had O
me O
send O
it O
in O
. O

returned O
it O
. O

5 O
months O
dead O
again O
. O

they O
say O
sorry O
out O
of O
warranty O
. O

summary O
: O
they O
played O
games O
with O
me O
for O
the O
warranty O
period O
. O

now O
17 O
months O
later O
they O
want O
( O
would O
not O
say O
exact O
amount O
) O
$ O
165.00 O
to O
$ O
400 O
to O
fix O
the O
machine O
. O

they O
had O
me O
send O
in O
the O
machine O
last O
april O
returned O
it O
to O
me O
in O
may O
with O
no O
documentation O
on O
what O
was O
done O
it O
anything O
. O

now O
the O
machine O
wo O
n't O
connect O
and O
toshiba O
says O
that O
they O
did O
replace O
the O
connection O
card O
in O
may O
but O
they O
only O
warranty O
the O
repair O
for O
30 O
days O
and O
now O
i O
'm O
out O
of O
warranty O
even O
though O
this O
has O
been O
a O
constant O
5 O
month O
occurance O
since O
i O
bought O
the O
netbook O
. O

so O
buyer O
beware O
when O
buying O
toshiba O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
the O
moment O
unibody O
product O
came O
to O
the O
market O
. O

i O
also O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
3 O
for O
my O
office O
. O

they O
are O
wonderful O
, O
but O
very O
dangerous O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
emitting O
heat O
. O

i O
burned O
my O
leg O
, O
after O
lifting O
it O
from O
my O
desk O
, O
and O
for O
less O
than O
5 O
second O
putting O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
to O
clean O
my O
coffee O
table O
, O
so O
i O
can O
place O
it O
there O
. O

i O
had O
to O
call O
apple O
19 O
times O
( O
each O
time O
40 O
to O
75 O
minutes O
on O
the O
phone O
) O
, O
and O
take O
it O
to O
their O
store O
for O
evaluations O
, O
and O
diagnostics O
, O
5 O
times O
. O

this O
is O
what O
they O
told O
me O
: O
it O
heats O
up O
, O
and O
that O
is O
the O
reason O
we O
no O
longer O
call O
them O
laptops O
, O
and O
simply O
categorize O
them O
as O
portables O
. O

you O
might O
think O
, O
i O
am O
new O
in O
this O
game O
, O
but O
i O
am O
a O
gadget O
lover O
, O
and O
have O
had O
more O
than O
2 O
dozens O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
15 O
years O
, O
and O
none O
gets O
this O
hot O
, O
that O
fast O
. O

i O
also O
experience O
the O
same O
with O
my O
macbook O
air O
. O

so O
you O
might O
ask O
, O
what O
did O
apple O
do O
for O
me O
? O

for O
my O
burn O
thigh O
which O
has O
put O
a O
permanent O
mark O
on O
my O
skin O
( O
it O
happened O
7 O
months O
ago O
) O
they O
offered O
me O
an O
itouch O
8gig O
( O
you O
know O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
insulating O
when O
a O
company O
this O
rich O
, O
offer O
a O
loyal O
customer O
like O
me O
, O
a O
bottom O
of O
their O
product O
line O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
events O
like O
this O
) O
. O

steve O
jobs O
, O
probably O
needs O
help O
and O
donations O
, O
and O
can O
not O
afford O
a O
reasonable O
offers O
for O
people O
that O
truly O
are O
trying O
to O
support O
his O
baby O
. O

the O
lesson O
learned O
here O
is O
: O
it O
does O
not O
pay O
to O
by O
this O
loyal O
to O
any O
brand O
, O
since O
all O
of O
them O
are O
there O
to O
simply O
to O
make O
as O
much O
money O
as O
possible O
, O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
, O
and O
in O
this O
day O
and O
age O
, O
the O
customer O
no O
longer O
is O
right O
all O
the O
times O
. O

sad O
very O
sad O
. O

i O
had O
meant O
to O
purchase O
the O
nb205 O
and O
bought O
this O
one O
by O
accident O
( O
long O
story O
) O
. O

i O
am O
not O
going O
to O
sit O
here O
and O
complain O
about O
it O
not O
having O
a O
cd O
drive O
and O
what O
not O
because O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
, O
it O
is O
made O
to O
be O
compact O
and O
if O
you O
want O
all O
the O
other O
stuff O
get O
a O
laptop O
. O

anyways O
i O
bought O
this O
two O
months O
ago O
and O
when O
i O
first O
brought O
it O
home O
it O
kept O
giving O
me O
a O
message O
about O
a O
vibration O
in O
the O
hard O
drive O
and O
it O
is O
putting O
it O
temporaly O
in O
save O
zone O
. O

so O
i O
called O
customer O
support O
( O
which O
is O
good O
too O
) O
and O
they O
went O
through O
it O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
safety O
feature O
and O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
performance O
at O
all O
, O
i O
just O
chose O
to O
hide O
the O
message O
. O

i O
have O
had O
the O
netbook O
for O
2 O
months O
and O
i O
love O
it O
, O
i O
read O
some O
reviews O
that O
say O
netbooks O
are O
slow O
but O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
any O
slower O
than O
the O
other O
computers O
i O
use O
. O

also O
the O
speakers O
are O
not O
very O
loud O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
. O

would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
netbook O
though O
. O

i O
paid O
for O
extra O
memory O
and O
the O
17-inch O
screen O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
top O
of O
the O
line O
dvd O
and O
cd O
burners O
. O

i O
custom O
ordered O
the O
machine O
from O
hp O
and O
could O
not O
understand O
the O
techie O
due O
to O
his O
accent O
. O

finally O
was O
able O
to O
reach O
a O
young O
lady O
in O
california O
and O
ordered O
the O
machine O
and O
was O
subsequently O
given O
a O
delivery O
date O
. O

the O
leather O
carrying O
case O
, O
keyboard O
and O
mouse O
arrived O
in O
two O
days O
from O
memphis O
warehouse O
. O

the O
computer O
was O
two O
weeks O
late O
in O
delivery O
because O
hp O
forgot O
to O
complete O
the O
required O
import O
paperwork O
. O

my O
laptop O
cost O
approximately O
$ O
2,300 O
and O
died O
after O
only O
2-years O
, O
10-months O
and O
18-days O
of O
use O
. O

although O
my O
model O
was O
listed O
as O
recalled O
, O
hp O
denied O
my O
claim O
. O

accordingly O
, O
i O
have O
decided O
to O
never O
purchase O
another O
hp O
product O
( O
my O
five O
year O
old O
compaq O
) O
lasted O
5-years O
before O
the O
hard O
drive O
crashed O
. O

i O
visited O
the O
apple O
store O
and O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
17-inch O
macbook O
pro O
. O

the O
quality O
, O
engineering O
design O
and O
warranty O
are O
superior O
-- O
covers O
damage O
from O
dropping O
the O
laptop O
. O

if O
the O
number O
of O
patrons O
in O
the O
apple O
store O
are O
any O
indication O
, O
hp O
and O
other O
pc O
manufacturers O
need O
to O
take O
note O
. O

this O
laptop O
leaves O
alot O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
i O
have O
had O
it O
only O
5 O
months O
and O
have O
had O
to O
send O
it O
away O
to O
be O
repaired O
twice O
... O

i O
bought O
it O
from O
hsn O
because O
it O
was O
`` O
bundled O
'' O
with O
extra O
software O
, O
but O
as O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
that O
software O
just O
crashes O
it O
more O
often O
... O
.. O

if O
you O
shop O
around O
in O
the O
current O
market O
you O
can O
find O
a O
much O
better O
deal O
. O

the O
repairs O
were O
made O
quickly O
though O
i O
must O
say O
, O
however O
the O
second O
time O
they O
shipped O
it O
to O
the O
incorrect O
address O
and O
it O
took O
nearly O
a O
week O
for O
them O
to O
get O
it O
to O
me O
. O

unable O
to O
boot O
up O
this O
brand O
new O
laptop O
. O

spent O
2 O
hours O
on O
phone O
with O
hp O
technical O
support O
. O

they O
went O
through O
asking O
me O
open O
up O
various O
components O
, O
taking O
battery O
out O
, O
hard O
disk O
apart O
, O
and O
after O
2 O
hours O
on O
phone O
could O
not O
fix O
it O
. O

they O
are O
asking O
me O
to O
ship O
the O
unit O
back O
to O
fix O
it O
at O
their O
site O
. O

i O
am O
going O
to O
go O
back O
and O
return O
at O
store O
i O
bought O
from O
! O

this O
computer O
had O
exactly O
the O
specifications O
i O
needed O
. O

small O
enough O
to O
use O
on O
a O
long O
flight O
, O
light O
enough O
to O
carry O
through O
airports O
and O
powerful O
enough O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
while O
on O
long O
business O
trips O
. O

the O
perfect O
notebook O
... O

when O
i O
finally O
had O
everything O
running O
with O
all O
my O
software O
installed O
i O
plugged O
in O
my O
droid O
to O
recharge O
and O
the O
system O
crashed O
. O

the O
aspire O
wont O
even O
boot O
past O
the O
acer O
screen O
with O
a O
droid O
( O
i O
have O
tried O
both O
motorola O
and O
htc O
) O
plugged O
into O
the O
usb O
port O
. O

called O
tech O
support O
and O
got O
the O
usual O
acer O
`` O
we O
do O
n't O
support O
software O
but O
for O
$ O
$ O
$ O
we O
can O
help O
you O
'' O
i O
explained O
there O
was O
no O
software O
involved O
in O
booting O
. O

no O
, O
tey O
do O
n't O
even O
support O
their O
own O
bios O
and O
it O
`` O
could O
be O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
bios O
'' O
how O
can O
a O
company O
that O
makes O
a O
fairly O
decent O
product O
get O
away O
with O
such O
insanity O
? O
? O
! O
! O

needless O
to O
say O
a O
pc O
that O
ca O
n't O
support O
a O
cell O
phone O
is O
less O
than O
useless O
! O

with O
today O
's O
company O
fighting O
over O
marketshare O
, O
its O
a O
shame O
that O
asus O
can O
get O
away O
with O
the O
inept O
staff O
answering O
thephone O
. O

i O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
comment O
that O
asus O
tech O
support O
is O
horrible O
which O
is O
a O
con O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

summary O
: O
i O
've O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
2 O
months O
, O
out O
of O
the O
blue O
the O
power O
adapter O
stops O
working O
. O

call O
tech O
support O
, O
standard O
email O
the O
form O
and O
fax O
it O
back O
in O
to O
us O
. O

i O
called O
back O
to O
ensure O
that O
received O
it O
, O
they O
had O
. O

but O
no O
one O
could O
tell O
me O
when O
my O
part O
would O
be O
shipped O
nor O
could O
they O
tell O
me O
where O
to O
buy O
it O
on O
their O
website O
! O
! O
! O

frustrated O
i O
hung O
up O
and O
tried O
to O
call O
back O
3 O
days O
later O
to O
be O
told O
that O
it O
takes O
2-3 O
days O
for O
turnaround O
time O
. O

this O
was O
the O
3rd O
day O
and O
part O
still O
had O
not O
been O
shipped O
. O

asked O
the O
customer O
service O
rep O
. O

if O
it O
's O
not O
shipped O
on O
the O
next O
business O
day O
, O
called O
on O
a O
friday O
they O
are O
closed O
on O
weekends O
, O
what O
was O
the O
next O
step O
. O

the O
rep O
did O
not O
even O
answer O
my O
question O
, O
i O
had O
to O
ask O
him O
, O
if O
he O
understood O
what O
i O
ask O
or O
if O
he O
spoke O
english O
because O
he O
did O
n't O
even O
try O
to O
acknowledge O
my O
question O
. O

was O
searching O
online O
for O
a O
power O
supply O
when O
i O
found O
this O
site O
. O

i O
'm O
tired O
of O
the O
inept O
service O
. O

if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
pc O
do O
not O
buy O
from O
asus O
! O
! O
! O

unless O
you O
want O
to O
be O
inconvenienced O
with O
a O
non O
working O
power O
supply O
which O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O
replacement O
for O
because O
they O
made O
the O
attachment O
so O
small O
. O

i O
'm O
really O
frustrated O
by O
this O
experience O
. O

how O
does O
the O
power O
supply O
not O
work O
! O
! O
! O

i O
spoke O
with O
a O
service O
rep O
at O
micro O
center O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
is O
having O
the O
same O
problem O
with O
her O
power O
adapter O
, O
so O
it O
's O
not O
just O
an O
isolated O
incident O
! O
! O
! O

our O
apple O
13.3 O
macbook O
pro O
notebook O
computer O
( O
z0j80001 O
) O
notebook O
and O
has O
become O
such O
an O
integral O
part O
of O
completing O
our O
daily O
needs O
and O
social O
networking O
. O

i O
do O
everything O
on O
this O
computer O
- O
check O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
shop O
, O
check O
blogs O
, O
write O
papers O
, O
listen O
to O
music O
, O
and O
we O
even O
watch O
all O
of O
our O
movies O
on O
it O
since O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
tv O
. O

it O
pretty O
much O
does O
everything O
we O
could O
ever O
need O
, O
and O
looks O
great O
to O
boot O
. O

apple O
is O
always O
great O
about O
the O
aesthetics O
of O
things O
, O
they O
always O
come O
up O
with O
good O
looking O
products O
. O

it O
did O
n't O
take O
me O
long O
to O
get O
switched O
over O
to O
the O
mac O
computer O
programs O
and O
navigation O
- O
it O
's O
been O
just O
fine O
and O
like O
the O
way O
this O
laptop O
functions O
much O
better O
. O

so O
, O
if O
you O
're O
thinking O
of O
a O
laptop O
, O
i O
would O
heartily O
recommend O
theapple O
13.3 O
macbook O
pro O
notebook O
computer O
( O
z0j80001 O
) O
notebook O
for O
all O
your O
needs O
! O

it O
's O
great O
and O
we O
will O
always O
stick O
with O
apple O
computers O
, O
we O
have O
been O
so O
happy O
with O
them O
. O

i O
know O
that O
everyone O
thinks O
macs O
are O
overpriced O
and O
overrated O
, O
but O
once O
you O
get O
past O
the O
initial O
expense O
you O
'll O
find O
that O
they O
're O
worth O
every O
penny O
( O
besides O
, O
there O
's O
always O
the O
financing O
plan O
that O
best O
buy O
offers O
) O
. O

the O
13 O
'' O
macbook O
pro O
is O
portable O
, O
durable O
, O
and O
very O
capable O
. O

it O
has O
a O
10 O
hour O
battery O
life O
when O
you O
're O
doing O
web O
browsing O
and O
word O
editing O
, O
making O
it O
perfect O
for O
the O
classroom O
or O
office O
, O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
gaming O
and O
movie O
playing O
it O
'll O
have O
a O
battery O
life O
of O
just O
over O
5 O
hours O
. O

it O
's O
also O
very O
energy O
efficient O
, O
running O
on O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
power O
it O
takes O
to O
run O
a O
60 O
watt O
lightbulb O
. O

it O
's O
graphics O
are O
n't O
bad O
at O
all O
, O
for O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
macbook O
pro O
spectrum O
, O
easily O
capable O
of O
running O
starcraft O
ii O
and O
other O
games O
with O
comparable O
graphics O
. O

it O
's O
also O
very O
capable O
of O
doing O
moderate O
video O
editing O
( O
although O
you O
may O
need O
the O
performance O
boost O
of O
the O
larger O
macbook O
pros O
for O
heavy O
duty O
mobile O
video O
editing O
) O
. O

the O
operating O
system O
and O
user O
interface O
is O
very O
intuitive O
, O
and O
the O
large O
multi-touch O
track O
pad O
is O
amazing O
. O

typically O
, O
when O
i O
purchase O
a O
new O
laptop O
i O
always O
end O
up O
using O
an O
external O
mouse O
for O
convenience O
. O

however O
, O
the O
multi-touch O
gestures O
and O
large O
tracking O
area O
make O
having O
an O
external O
mouse O
unnecessary O
( O
unless O
you O
're O
gaming O
) O
. O

still O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
perfect O
for O
all O
day O
use O
at O
school O
and O
work O
. O

they O
also O
have O
a O
longer O
service O
life O
than O
other O
computers O
( O
i O
have O
several O
friends O
who O
still O
use O
the O
older O
apple O
powerbooks O
) O
. O

me O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
bought O
the O
gateway O
nv78 O
in O
nov O
of O
09 O
. O

bought O
with O
a O
credit O
card O
. O

probbly O
the O
worst O
decision O
we O
ever O
made O
! O

it O
has O
bein O
into O
the O
shop O
to O
get O
a O
new O
hardrive O
2 O
times O
and O
to O
fix O
the O
touch O
control O
buttons O
on O
the O
keyboard O
! O

the O
place O
we O
bought O
it O
from O
said O
that O
after O
they O
send O
it O
out O
to O
gateway O
4 O
times O
they O
would O
give O
us O
a O
new O
one O
. O

the O
last O
time O
we O
took O
it O
to O
get O
fixed O
the O
guy O
said O
that O
most O
likely O
it O
is O
a O
reppative O
problem O
and O
will O
keep O
happeneing O
so O
hopefully O
we O
can O
get O
a O
new O
one O
very O
soon O
! O

pretty O
much O
everything O
else O
about O
the O
computer O
is O
good O
it O
just O
stops O
working O
out O
of O
no O
were O
. O

i O
love O
the O
size O
of O
the O
computer O
since O
i O
play O
games O
on O
it O
. O

i O
also O
love O
having O
the O
extra O
calculator O
number O
set O
up O
on O
the O
keyboard O
which O
most O
laptops O
do O
not O
have O
. O

also O
the O
keyboard O
does O
not O
liht O
up O
so O
unless O
your O
sitting O
in O
a O
room O
with O
some O
light O
you O
cant O
see O
anything O
and O
thats O
bad O
for O
me O
because O
my O
boyfriend O
tends O
to O
watch O
tv O
in O
the O
dark O
at O
night O
which O
leaves O
me O
with O
no O
way O
of O
seeing O
the O
keyboard O
. O

so O
i O
would O
not O
reccomend O
anyone O
buying O
this O
computer O

first O
, O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
push O
button O
to O
open O
the O
lid O
. O

it O
is O
held O
in O
place O
magnetically O
. O

there O
is O
a O
little O
indent O
to O
help O
open O
it O
- O
but O
good O
luck O
with O
that O
. O

once O
open O
, O
the O
leading O
edge O
is O
razor O
sharp O
. O

this O
is O
the O
complete O
opposite O
to O
an O
ergonomic O
design O
. O

using O
this O
machine O
is O
like O
a O
mild O
form O
of O
torture O
. O

in O
the O
shop O
, O
these O
macbooks O
are O
encased O
in O
a O
soft O
rubber O
enclosure O
- O
so O
you O
will O
never O
know O
about O
the O
razor O
edge O
until O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
get O
it O
home O
, O
break O
the O
seal O
and O
use O
it O
( O
very O
clever O
con O
) O
. O

the O
much O
lauded O
combined O
touch O
pad O
and O
clicker O
is O
a O
nightmare O
. O

i O
lost O
two O
items O
i O
was O
working O
on O
until O
i O
figured O
out O
what O
was O
happening O
. O

also O
, O
the O
space O
bar O
makes O
a O
noisy O
click O
every O
time O
you O
use O
it O
. O

i O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
, O
but O
if O
i O
could O
take O
this O
back O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
get O
my O
money O
back O
, O
then O
i O
would O
. O

it O
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
to O
use O
, O
despite O
all O
its O
so O
called O
advanced O
features O
. O

i O
regret O
buying O
it O
before O
understanding O
how O
awful O
it O
is O
to O
use O
. O

buy O
this O
if O
you O
like O
being O
tortured O
, O
teased O
, O
frustrated O
and O
wasting O
twice O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
spent O
using O
your O
old O
mac O
. O

it O
's O
a O
bummer O
and O
one O
out O
of O
five O
is O
being O
kind O
. O

my O
mac O
has O
gone O
from O
being O
a O
trusted O
friend O
to O
an O
adversary O
. O

i O
'm O
going O
to O
try O
and O
keep O
my O
old O
g4 O
on O
the O
road O
for O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O

in O
due O
course O
, O
i O
'll O
remove O
the O
hard O
disc O
from O
this O
new O
macbook O
pro O
and O
dump O
it O
where O
it O
belongs O
- O
in O
the O
trash O
. O

this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
i O
tried O
and O
owning O
a O
netbook O
although O
i O
have O
used O
3 O
different O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
10 O
years O
, O
i O
find O
not O
much O
difference O
except O
of O
course O
for O
the O
screen O
size O
. O

but O
the O
screen O
size O
is O
not O
that O
bad O
for O
email O
and O
web O
browsing O
. O

i O
like O
this O
machine O
because O
its O
very O
lightweight O
... O

very O
convenient O
when O
you O
travel O
and O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
excellent O
... O

10 O
hours O
of O
battery O
life O
is O
really O
something O
else O
... O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
that O
you O
buy O
this O
product O
. O

i O
've O
owned O
every O
`` O
pro O
'' O
model O
apple O
laptop O
for O
the O
last O
8 O
years O
, O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
worst O
one O
i O
've O
ever O
had O
. O

it O
crashes O
, O
and O
when O
it O
goes O
flat O
, O
it O
just O
dies O
( O
like O
a O
pc O
, O
maybe O
worse O
) O
and O
i O
loose O
all O
my O
open O
documents O
! O

i O
hate O
it O
! O

it O
is O
the O
easiest O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O

i O
have O
had O
some O
excellent O
computer O
and O
have O
found O
i O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
to O
do O
with O
them O

i O
saw O
this O
one O
, O
and O
i O
have O
the O
most O
difficult O
time O
trying O
to O
use O
them O
, O
they O
've O
made O
great O
dust O
collectors O
, O
i O
hate O
putting O
this O
computer O
down O

i O
love O
it O
! O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
for O
it O

just O
a O
great O

around O

very O
very O
slow O

tons O
of O

ca O

lots O
of O
extra O

the O

amazing O

but O
since O
it O
has O
a O
18.4 O
'' O
screen O
what O
would O
you O
expect O
! O

it O
is O
truly O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
. O

very O
fast O
and O
efficient O
! O

does O
a O
great O
job O
with O
video O
shot O
on O
a O
canon O
5d O
mkii O
. O

very O
happy O
with O
my O
7th O
toshiba O
laptop O
! O

the O
touchpad O
is O
very O
intuitive O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
i O
never O
want O
to O
use O
buttons O
to O
click O
again O
! O

the O
computer O
loads O
in O
about O
a O
1/10th O
of O
the O
time O
that O
my O
pc O
did O
, O
and O
i O
have O
all O
of O
the O
programs O
that O
were O
on O
my O
pc O
. O

of O
course O
, O
i O
also O
have O
several O
great O
software O
packages O
that O
came O
for O
free O
including O
iwork O
, O
garageband O
, O
and O
imovie O
. O

i O
especially O
appreciate O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
almost O
zero O
viruses O
and O
spyware O
problems O
! O

the O
only O
drawback O
for O
me O
is O
how O
dirty O
the O
screen O
gets O
, O
and O
rather O
quickly O
too O
. O

i O
'm O
hoping O
that O
i O
can O
find O
a O
really O
quick O
way O
to O
clean O
it O
without O
it O
getting O
too O
gross O
. O

i O
also O
enjoy O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
macbook O
pro O
laptop O
allows O
me O
to O
run O
windows O
7 O
on O
it O
by O
using O
the O
vmware O
program O
. O

now O
i O
have O
the O
best O
of O
both O
worlds O
with O
all O
of O
the O
power O
and O
ease O
of O
the O
mac O
! O

i O
also O
got O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
30 O
'' O
hd O
monitor O
, O
which O
really O
helps O
to O
extend O
my O
screen O
and O
keep O
my O
eyes O
fresh O
! O

i O
never O
have O
had O
a O
good O
result O
with O
this O
computer O
. O

i O
was O
told O
by O
many O
that O
it O
was O
a O
great O
computer O
, O
but O
we O
got O
one O
of O
these O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
great O
for O
one O
year O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
warrenty O
was O
up O
, O
then O
it O
got O
really O
bad O
. O

they O
told O
me O
it O
was O
my O
loss O
even O
though O
it O
was O
the O
computer O
, O
not O
what O
i O
've O
done O
. O

the O
hard O
drive O
crashed O
as O
well O
, O
and O
i O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
power O
cord O
. O

they O
told O
me O
to O
reprogram O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
i O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
do O
that O
, O
and O
i O
lost O
pictures O
of O
my O
oldests O
first O
2 O
years O
of O
her O
life O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
like O
this O
company O
nor O
the O
toshiba O
brand O
, O
and O
i O
'll O
never O
buy O
another O
one O
because O
i O
've O
put O
more O
into O
it O
then O
it O
is O
worth O
. O

i O
would O
rather O
spend O
my O
money O
on O
a O
computer O
that O
costs O
more O
then O
a O
toshiba O
that O
is O
n't O
good O
at O
all O
. O

i O
just O
bought O
this O
laptop O
3 O
days O
ago O
. O

the O
right O
speaker O
did O
not O
work O
. O

i O
took O
it O
back O
to O
the O
store O
and O
exchanged O
it O
for O
another O
one O
. O

again O
, O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
the O
right O
speaker O
did O
not O
work O
. O

i O
returned O
the O
2nd O
laptop O
for O
a O
full O
refund O
. O

the O
mouse O
pad O
and O
buttons O
are O
the O
worst O
i O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

sometimes O
you O
will O
be O
moving O
your O
finger O
and O
the O
pointer O
will O
not O
even O
move O
. O

the O
mouse O
buttons O
are O
hard O
to O
push O
. O

i O
cant O
believe O
hp O
put O
this O
out O
. O

do O
not O
buy O
you O
will O
be O
disappointed O
. O

i O
'm O
returning O
mine O

dell O
is O
a O
decently O
made O
pc O
. O

although O
its O
windows O
vista O
compared O
to O
windows O
xp O
sucks O
. O

the O
graphics O
are O
awful O
and O
the O
wireless O
switch O
it O
at O
the O
top O
rather O
than O
the O
side O
which O
i O
am O
used O
to O
it O
being O
on O
the O
side O
. O

with O
the O
switch O
being O
at O
the O
top O
you O
need O
to O
memorize O
the O
key O
combination O
rather O
than O
just O
flicking O
a O
switch O
. O

so O
in O
a O
brief O
summary O
i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
would O
not O
recommend O
dell O
vostro O
1000 O
to O
anyone O
due O
to O
it O
being O
a O
down O
right O
awful O
setup O
so O
in O
my O
opinion O
you O
should O
steer O
clear O
of O
them O
if O
you O
want O
a O
decent O
laptop O
. O

i O
love O
hp O
, O
, O
it O
's O
the O
only O
computer O
/ O
printer O
we O
will O
buy O
. O

got O
this O
for O
a O
graduation O
gift O
for O
my O
daughter O
for O
her O
to O
use O
at O
college O
. O

this O
is O
perfect O
for O
her O
field O
. O

at O
first O
when O
i O
got O
this O
product O
, O
i O
loved O
it O
. O

the O
computer O
itself O
was O
fast O
, O
ran O
smoothly O
, O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
. O

then O
, O
within O
5 O
months O
, O
the O
charger O
crapped O
out O
on O
me O
. O

so O
i O
called O
compaq O
, O
and O
after O
being O
on O
the O
phone O
for O
3 O
hours O
, O
i O
finally O
got O
a O
replacement O
which O
i O
should O
n't O
have O
had O
a O
problem O
getting O
since O
it O
was O
under O
warranty O
. O

2 O
months O
later O
, O
the O
battery O
went O
. O

they O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
yet O
again O
, O
but O
their O
was O
a O
malfunction O
in O
the O
battery O
itself O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
die O
. O

then O
, O
one O
month O
after O
the O
warranty O
expired O
, O
the O
replacement O
charger O
went O
. O

i O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
100 O
for O
a O
universal O
charger O
for O
this O
cheap O
$ O
300 O
laptop O
. O

not O
worth O
it O
one O
bit O
. O

the O
people O
are O
frustrating O
to O
work O
with O
, O
the O
product O
itself O
is O
very O
cheaply O
made O
, O
and O
the O
accessories O
are O
less O
than O
satisfactory O
. O

also O
, O
my O
sister O
got O
the O
exact O
same O
laptop O
( O
since O
they O
were O
so O
cheap O
) O
and O
after O
8 O
months O
, O
the O
screen O
split O
in O
half O
just O
from O
everyday O
use O
. O

apparently O
under O
the O
screen O
there O
are O
2 O
little O
screws O
and O
when O
the O
screen O
gets O
moved O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
they O
come O
loose O
. O

and O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
get O
them O
back O
in O
. O

two O
weeks O
ago O
i O
bought O
this O
notebook O
. O

what O
can O
i O
say O
. O

the O
first O
programm O
i O
switched O
on O
was O
a O
game O
for O
my O
children O
. O

after O
20-30 O
min O
the O
screen O
of O
the O
notebook O
switched O
off O
. O

it O
was O
still O
working O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
the O
screen O
. O

i O
was O
said O
it O
's O
videocard O
. O

very O
disappointed O
! O

did O
n't O
expect O
to O
repair O
it O
at O
once O
! O

going O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
service O
today O
. O

do O
n't O
buy O
this O
model O
. O

an O
absolutely O
hateful O
machine O
that O
no O
one O
should O
get O
of O
their O
own O
free O
will O
. O

i O
just O
ca O
n't O
fathom O
that O
the O
celebrated O
dell O
would O
last O
a O
week O
in O
environment O
of O
free O
competition O
with O
normal O
products O
- O
it O
only O
survives O
b/c O
its O
substandard O
laptops O
are O
forced O
onto O
captive O
students O
and O
employees O
through O
question-raising O
programs O
. O

mine O
came O
at O
$ O
1,700 O
w O
/ O
o O
a O
dvd O
burner O
( O
! O
) O
. O

enough O
said O
. O

the O
screen O
is O
framed O
by O
half- O
to O
a O
full-inch O
margin O
that O
is O
obviously O
unnecessary O
, O
reduces O
the O
screen O
size O
and O
increases O
the O
bulk O
. O

the O
4 O
usb O
ports O
are O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
two O
on O
the O
side O
only O
work O
now O
and O
then O
. O

keyboard O
could O
use O
some O
trimming O
. O

did O
i O
mention O
everything O
about O
it O
, O
from O
size O
to O
weight O
to O
keyboard O
screams O
bulk O
? O

i O
'm O
glad O
i O
made O
the O
choice O
to O
switch O
and O
buy O
this O
mac O
. O

the O
benefits O
were O
immediate O
! O

awesome O
graphics O
! O

applications O
respond O
immediately O
( O
not O
like O
the O
tired O
ms O
applications O
) O
. O

i O
can O
actually O
get O
work O
done O
with O
this O
mac O
, O
and O
not O
fight O
with O
it O
like O
my O
tired O
old O
pc O
laptop O
. O

the O
magnetic O
plug-in O
power O
charging O
power O
cord O
is O
great O
( O
i O
even O
put O
it O
to O
the O
test O
by O
accident O
) O
- O
excellent O
innovation O
! O

the O
apple O
applications O
( O
ex.iphoto O
) O
are O
fun O
, O
easy O
, O
and O
really O
cool O
to O
use O
( O
unlike O
the O
competition O
) O
! O

after O
doing O
cad O
work O
all O
day O
at O
work O
, O
using O
a O
higher O
end O
pc O
, O
i O
could O
n't O
come O
home O
and O
settle O
for O
the O
use O
of O
a O
lower O
end O
computer O
. O

this O
laptop O
rocks O
( O
only O
wish O
it O
could O
run O
solidworks O
cad O
- O
which O
apple O
does O
n't O
support O
) O
! O

i O
've O
saved O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
headaches O
so O
far O
, O
using O
my O
new O
macbook O
pro O
. O

i O
am O
definitely O
sold O
, O
and O
not O
going O
back O
to O
pcs O
for O
home O
use O
! O

i O
previously O
owned O
an O
hp O
desktop O
and O
a O
dell O
laptop O
. O

both O
computers O
started O
acting O
extremely O
slow O
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
owning O
them O
. O

i O
have O
never O
had O
any O
issues O
or O
problems O
with O
my O
macbook O
pro O
so O
far O
, O
and O
it O
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
was O
when O
i O
first O
bought O
it O
. O

i O
especially O
like O
the O
backlit O
keyboard O
. O

it O
makes O
doing O
schoolwork O
at O
night O
so O
much O
easier O
. O

it O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O
, O
making O
transporting O
this O
computer O
very O
easy O
. O

the O
graphics O
on O
this O
computer O
are O
also O
stellar O
- O
very O
clear O
and O
vivid O
. O

the O
applications O
are O
also O
very O
easy O
to O
find O
and O
maneuver O
, O
much O
easier O
than O
any O
other O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

i O
use O
iphoto O
all O
the O
time O
, O
which O
is O
a O
great O
program O
for O
anyone O
who O
is O
into O
photography O
- O
amateurs O
and O
experts O
alike O
. O

the O
program O
came O
with O
the O
computer O
and O
works O
beautifully O
. O

i O
definitely O
will O
buy O
a O
mac O
again O
if O
and O
when O
this O
computer O
ever O
fails O
. O

my O
hp O
g60-244dx O
died O
after O
only O
16 O
months O
. O

it O
started O
out O
getting O
hot O
after O
only O
a O
few O
months O
. O

i O
should O
have O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
them O
then O
. O

at O
16 O
months O
it O
started O
shutting O
off O
after O
only O
5 O
or O
10 O
minutes O
. O

i O
use O
a O
cooling O
pad O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
. O

i O
took O
it O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
they O
said O
it O
would O
cost O
too O
much O
to O
repair O
it O
. O

i O
had O
a O
toshiba O
for O
10 O
years O
. O

i O
'll O
stick O
to O
tashiba O
. O

i O
will O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
love O
my O
macbook O
pro O
! O

it O
fires O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
in O
less O
than O
30 O
seconds O
and O
i O
have O
never O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
it O
freezing O
. O

i O
have O
used O
different O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
i O
have O
to O
rate O
this O
one O
way O
above O
the O
rest O
. O

this O
is O
now O
my O
3rd O
macbook O
pro O
and O
i O
really O
honestly O
love O
it O
! O

the O
newer O
black O
keyboard O
took O
a O
little O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
previous O
gray O
one O
which O
looked O
really O
slick O
, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
great O
notebook O
! O

the O
macbook O
pro O
is O
very O
sturdy O
and O
versatile O
. O

i O
love O
it O
! O

i O
even O
got O
my O
teenage O
son O
one O
, O
because O
of O
the O
features O
that O
it O
offers O
, O
like O
, O
ichat O
, O
photobooth O
, O
garage O
band O
and O
more O
! O

we O
are O
addicted O
to O
the O
mac O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

the O
os O
takes O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
especially O
after O
being O
a O
windows O
user O
for O
so O
long O
but O
the O
learning O
curve O
is O
so O
worth O
it O
! O

great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features O
! O

lightweight O
and O
the O
screen O
is O
beautiful O
! O

i O
have O
had O
my O
new O
macbook O

i5 O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
and O

pc O
laptops O
. O

easy O
to O
operate O
and O
i O
have O
already O
ordered O
more O
software O
and O
gadgets O
for O
my O
new O
rolls O
royce O
of O

before O
i O
bought O
my O
new O
i5 O
, O
i O
did O
my O
research O
for O
about O
2 O
weeks O
and O
determined O
to O

for O
hp O
to O
apple O
for O
reliability O
, O
dependable O
, O
and O
long O
lasting O
operations O
. O

so O
i O
can O

it O
takes O
me O
approximately O
3 O
tries O
to O
get O
to O
each O
site O
, O
then O
after O
closing O
the O

and O
reopening O
it O
it O
actually O
works O
. O

i O
have O
vista O

so O
i O
am O
unable O
to O
install O
and O
uninstall O
some O

i O
ca O
n't O
even O
install O
one O
of O
the O
3 O

i O
have O

my O

externally O
the O
keys O
on O
my O
keyboard O
are O
falling O
off O
, O
after O
a O
few O
uses O
the O
paint O
is O
rubbing O
off O
the O
button O
below O
the O
mouse O
pad O
and O
where O
the O
heals O
of O
my O
hands O
sit O
, O
and O
the O
screen O
has O
a O
terrible O
glare O
. O

in O
short O
i O
would O
never O
buy O
a O
compaq O
again O
. O

my O
last O
computer O
, O
a O
toshiba O
, O
cost O
only O
$ O
400 O
, O
and O
worked O
like O
a O
charm O
for O
many O
years O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
on O
saturday O
and O
am O
completely O
in O
love O
with O
it O
! O

it O
was O
super O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
and O
is O
really O
easy O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O

the O
online O
tutorial O
videos O
make O
it O
super O
easy O
to O
learn O
if O
you O
have O
always O
used O
a O
pc O
. O

i O
now O
travel O
with O
this O
laptop O
and O
my O
work O
pc O
. O

i O
love O
the O
mac O
so O
much O
better O
than O
my O
work O
pc O
! O

i O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
windows O
! O

never O
any O
doubt O
i O
would O
get O
a O
macbook O
, O
just O
was O
n't O
sure O
which O
one O
. O

after O
talking O
it O
over O
with O
the O
very O
knowledgeable O
sales O
associate O
, O
i O
chose O
the O
macbook O
pro O
over O
the O
white O
macbook O
. O

the O
performance O
is O
awesome O
. O

i O
will O
never O
complain O
about O
the O
price O
since O
i O
believe O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
my O
macbook O
pro O
was O
worth O
every O
dollar O
. O

with O
all O
the O
goodies O
inside O
this O
machine O
, O
it O
is O
a O
value O
. O

it O
is O
very O
well O
built O
. O

the O
keyboard O
is O
top O
notch O
. O

the O
touch O
pad O
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

the O
screen O
is O
huge O
and O
coloful O
, O
but O
no O
led O
backlighting O
. O

the O
video O
card O
is O
great O
for O
media O
, O
and O
above O
average O
for O
gaming O
, O
but O
not O
a O
gamers O
first O
choice O
. O

the O
problem O
i O
had O
with O
this O
unit O
was O
unresolvable O
. O

it O
had O
a O
cooling O
system O
malfunction O
after O
10 O
minutes O
of O
general O
use O
, O
and O
would O
not O
move O
past O
this O
error O
. O

i O
realize O
that O
not O
every O
unit O
has O
this O
issue O
, O
but O
the O
ones O
that O
do O
can O
not O
be O
repaired O
. O

i O
acually O
believe O
the O
issue O
is O
with O
the O
nvidia O
grafics O
card O
, O
but O
still O
requires O
a O
return O
. O

instead O
of O
taking O
another O
chance O
on O
toshiba O
, O
i O
went O
with O
an O
asus O
g73jh-x3 O
. O

they O
offer O
the O
best O
warranty O
in O
the O
business O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
3rd O
party O
it O
out O
like O
toshiba O
. O

for O
the O
same O
price O
, O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
more O
in O
the O
asus O
... O
.1920x1080 O
res./ O
awesome O
cooling O
system/ O
much O
better O
grafics O
card O
( O
ati O
5870 O
) O
/ O
8gb O
ram/ O
led O
backlit O
screen O
... O

sorry O
toshiba O
, O
but O
1st O
impressions O
do O
count O
for O
something O
. O

i O
got O
the O
black O
macbook O
two O
years O
ago O
and O
have O
never O
regretted O
it O
. O

it O
was O
a O
hard O
decision O
for O
me O
since O
the O
macbook O
pro O
looked O
so O
appealing O
. O

but O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
i O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
computer O
for O
anything O
like O
graphics O
editing O
and O
complex O
data O
analysis O
and O
gaming O
. O

so O
this O
was O
great O
for O
me O
. O

it O
has O
just O
enough O
ram O
to O
run O
smoothly O
and O
enough O
memory O
to O
satisfy O
my O
needs O
. O

plus O
it O
is O
small O
and O
reasonably O
light O
so O
i O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
to O
and O
from O
work O
. O

i O
also O
travel O
with O
it O
and O
it O
never O
gives O
me O
any O
problems O
. O

it O
was O
also O
cheaper O
than O
the O
pro O
which O
made O
it O
even O
more O
appealing O
to O
me O
. O

sadly O
apple O
has O
discontinued O
this O
macbook O
, O
i O
think O
it O
was O
never O
super O
popular O
since O
it O
fell O
somewhere O
in O
between O
the O
cheapest O
white O
model O
and O
the O
smaller O
pros O
. O

but O
i O
am O
glad O
to O
have O
gotten O
mine O
right O
before O
they O
stopped O
making O
it O
. O

i O
look O
forward O
to O
years O
of O
use O
, O
it O
has O
held O
up O
well O
over O
the O
years O
and O
it O
fits O
my O
needs O
very O
well O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
to O
replace O
my O
compaq O
laptop O
. O

i O
paid O
about O
the O
same O
for O
my O
toshiba O
as O
i O
did O
for O
the O
compaq O
a O
few O
years O
back O
. O

the O
difference O
is O
the O
toshiba O
had O
a O
lot O
more O
memory O
and O
hard O
drive O
space O
. O

it O
's O
super O
fast O
and O
a O
great O
value O
for O
the O
price O
! O

i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
checking O
out O
this O
laptop O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
. O

no O
complaints O
with O
their O
desktop O
, O
and O
maybe O
because O
it O
just O
sits O
on O
your O
desktop O
, O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
carry O
it O
around O
, O
which O
could O
jar O
the O
hard O
drive O
, O
or O
the O
motherboard O
. O

bought O
this O
gateway O
m-50 O
or O
150 O
early O
2007 O
. O

a O
month O
later O
, O
we O
reinstall O
the O
os O
( O
vista O
) O
. O

a O
coupla O
months O
later O
, O
they O
change O
my O
hard O
drive O
. O

a O
month O
or O
so O
ago O
, O
the O
freaking O
motherboard O
just O
died O
. O

went O
silently O
. O

one O
night O
i O
turned O
the O
freaking O
thing O
off O
after O
using O
it O
, O
the O
next O
day O
i O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
no O
gui O
, O
screen O
all O
dark O
, O
power O
light O
steady O
, O
hard O
drive O
light O
steady O
and O
not O
flashing O
as O
it O
usually O
does O
. O

the O
motherboard O
is O
dead O
! O

and O
i O
'm O
still O
paying O
the O
bloody O
financing O
, O
for O
a O
product O
which O
did O
n't O
last O
me O
at O
least O
three O
years O
! O

i O
initially O
purchased O
my O
macbook O
pro O
13 O
'' O
in O
april O
, O
and O
i O
loved O
it O
. O

i O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
mac O
before O
; O

i O
had O
always O
used O
pcs O
and O
been O
constantly O
frustrated O
by O
the O
crashing O
and O
the O
poorly O
designed O
operating O
systems O
that O
were O
never O
very O
intuitive O
. O

i O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
my O
new O
mac O
. O

for O
2 O
months O
. O

then O
the O
hard O
drive O
failed O
; O

my O
information O
was O
all O
lost O
( O
my O
fault O
, O
i O
know O
, O
but O
i O
never O
thought O
i O
would O
need O
to O
back O
up O
my O
information O
on O
a O
brand O
new O
mac O
, O
the O
paragon O
of O
all O
computers O
! O

so O
, O
after O
apple O
replaced O
the O
hard O
drive O
i O
enjoyed O
another O
4 O
months O
of O
my O
new O
computer O
, O
until O
it O
froze O
this O
morning O
-- O
completely O
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
even O
turn O
it O
off O
. O

it O
's O
catatonic O
. O

even O
if O
apple O
replaces O
whatever O
needs O
replacing O
i O
wonder O
if O
, O
since O
i O
seem O
to O
be O
doubling O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
i O
get O
out O
of O
it O
each O
time O
it O
's O
`` O
like O
new O
, O
'' O
i O
might O
have O
8 O
months O
next O
time O
. O

oh O
, O
boy O
! O

i O
would O
rate O
this O
computer O
at O
5 O
stars O
, O
but O
considering O
it O
has O
a O
short O
life O
span O
i O
can O
only O
give O
it O
1 O
and O
implore O
anyone O
looking O
at O
laptops O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
machine O
. O

i O
'm O
going O
back O
to O
pc O
. O

at O
least O
those O
computers O
did O
n't O
just O
die O
on O
me O
like O
this O
one O
. O

great O
battery O
, O
speed O
, O
display O
. O

it O
works O
! O

i O
always O
swore O
by O
pcs O
and O
would O
never O
consider O
a O
mac O
. O

as O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
i O
just O
did O
n't O
know O
any O
better O
. O

my O
house O
is O
now O
100 O
% O
macbook O
. O

the O
macbook O
starts O
fast O
, O
does O
n't O
crash O
, O
has O
a O
fantastic O
display O
, O
is O
small O
and O
light O
( O
i O
have O
the O
13.3 O
'' O
model O
) O
, O
and O
is O
n't O
always O
complaining O
about O
updates O
, O
lost O
connections O
, O
errors O
, O
blue O
screens O
, O
etc O
. O

this O
is O
what O
a O
laptop O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
. O

i O
thought O
the O
price O
was O
great O
for O
the O
specs O
. O

but O
after O
using O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
the O
overall O
operation O
is O
poor O
. O

i O
hate O
the O
display O
screen O
and O
i O
have O
done O
everything O
i O
could O
do O
the O
change O
it O
. O

the O
keyboard O
is O
too O
slick O
. O

i O
really O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
but O
i O
am O
stuck O
. O

dell O
latitude O
d620 O
is O
not O
a O
reliable O
machine O
. O

the O
battery O
never O
held O
a O
charge O
longer O
than O
one O
hour O
and O
within O
two O
months O
, O
stopped O
holding O
a O
charge O
for O
more O
than O
ten O
minutes O
. O

later O
it O
held O
zero O
charge O
and O
its O
replacement O
worked O
for O
less O
than O
three O
months O
. O

the O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot O
up O
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
. O

this O
is O
the O
first O
apple O
product O
that O
i O
have O
purchased O
. O

very O
disappointing O
: O

i O
was O
not O
aware O
that O
this O
product O
can O
not O
display O
websites O
that O
contain O
flash O
. O

about O
1/2 O
of O
the O
sites O
i O
need O
to O
visit O
because O
of O
my O
work O
contain O
some O
type O
of O
flash O
. O

web O
access O
through O
the O
3g O
network O
is O
so O
slow O
, O
it O
's O
very O
frustrating O
and O
very O
disappointing O
. O

one O
of O
the O
primary O
reasons O
why O
i O
purchased O
an O
ipad O
was O
to O
store O
photographs O
so O
that O
i O
could O
show O
to O
my O
customers O
. O

after O
purchasing O
this O
thing O
, O
i O
find O
out O
that O
i O
need O
a O
special O
interface O
device O
to O
connect O
my O
camera O
, O
and O
that O
it O
can O
not O
be O
purchased O
at O
the O
store O
- O
only O
on O
line O
. O

i O
go O
to O
purchase O
it O
on O
line O
, O
and O
i O
find O
out O
that O
the O
device O
will O
not O
be O
available O
until O
almost O
two O
months O
later O
! O

i O
now O
realize O
that O
my O
$ O
900 O
would O
have O
been O
better O
spent O
on O
a O
windows O
laptop O
. O

hp O
pavilion O
dv9000 O
notebook O
pc O
when O
i O
first O
got O
this O
computer O
, O
it O
really O
rocked O
. O

but O
as O
time O
went O
on O
i O
found O
it O
almost O
impossible O
to O
keep O
the O
thing O
on-line O
through O
wi-fi O
. O

eventually O
the O
screen O
went O
blank O
and O
the O
computer O
would O
not O
turn O
on O
. O

hp O
said O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty O
. O

guess O
i O
'll O
stay O
away O
from O
hp O
. O

my O
macbook O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
investment O
i O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

i O
have O
had O
it O
for O
almost O
four O
years O
now O
and O
i O
have O
only O
had O
a O
few O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

the O
most O
recent O
being O
that O
my O
safari O
internet O
browser O
is O
freaking O
out O
on O
me O
, O
but O
i O
have O
just O
been O
using O
firefox O
instead O
. O

if O
you O
had O
pc O
for O
four O
years O
i O
can O
almost O
gaurentee O
that O
something O
would O
of O
gone O
wrong O
by O
now O
, O
maybe O
even O
forcing O
you O
to O
replace O
your O
entire O
computer O
. O

i O
love O
this O
computer O
. O

its O
small O
enough O
where O
i O
can O
take O
it O
pretty O
much O
anywhere O
, O
but O
still O
has O
a O
big O
enough O
screen O
to O
get O
everything O
done O
. O

everything O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
mac O
software O
is O
just O
so O
much O
simpler O
than O
microsoft O
software O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
about O
my O
mac O
is O
that O
sometimes O
there O
are O
programs O
that O
i O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
and O
i O
am O
not O
able O
to O
. O

games O
being O
the O
main O
issue O
. O

it O
drives O
me O
crazy O
when O
i O
want O
to O
download O
a O
game O
or O
something O
of O
that O
nature O
and O
i O
ca O
n't O
play O
it O
because O
its O
not O
compatable O
with O
the O
software O
. O

i O
feel O
that O
enough O
people O
have O
macs O
these O
days O
and O
that O
companies O
need O
to O
start O
making O
things O
more O
compatable O
than O
they O
used O
to O
be O
. O

other O
than O
that O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
one O
complaint O
in O
the O
world O
! O

this O
computer O
periodically O
crashes O
( O
office O
, O
iphoto O
, O
safari O
) O
. O

it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
get O
on O
the O
web O
and O
to O
change O
web O
sites O
. O

locks O
up O
she O
searching O
for O
updates O
. O

just O
to O
be O
clear O
. O

i O
have O
been O
an O
apple O
user O
since O
they O
switched O
to O
intel O
. O

i O
have O
had O
macbook O
pros O
and O
macbook O
airs O
and O
have O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
. O

it O
seems O
that O
this O
computer O
might O
be O
a O
lemon O
. O

i O
purchased O
it O
through O
amazon O
. O

i O
have O
had O
one O
complaint O
into O
the O
supplier O
but O
got O
little O
support O
. O

i O
am O
taking O
the O
computer O
to O
apple O
to O
see O
what O
they O
think O
. O

i O
purchased O
my O
macbook O
pro O
retina O
from O
my O
school O
since O
i O
had O
a O
student O
discount O
, O
but O
i O
would O
gladly O
purchase O
it O
from O
amazon O
for O
full O
price O
again O
if O
i O
had O
too O
. O

the O
retina O
is O
great O
, O
its O
amazingly O
fast O
when O
it O
boots O
up O
because O
of O
the O
ssd O
storage O
and O
the O
clarity O
of O
the O
screen O
is O
amazing O
as O
well O
. O

but O
if O
you O
buy O
this O
i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
that O
you O
buy O
a O
case O
and O
screen O
protector O
for O
this O
machine O
as O
they O
are O
known O
to O
be O
quite O
fragile O
. O

count O
me O
as O
extremely O
satisfied O
, O
it O
's O
a O
perfect O
computer O
. O

i O
just O
bought O
this O
computer O
from O
the O
apple O
store O
, O
and O
i O
could O
n't O
be O
more O
impressed O
with O
it O
. O

it O
has O
a O
stunning O
retina O
display O
, O
and O
is O
very O
fast O
. O

the O
solid-state O
memory O
makes O
it O
a O
lot O
faster O
than O
previous O
macbook O
pro O
models O
that O
used O
a O
spinning O
hard O
drive O
. O

this O
computer O
is O
good O
for O
anything O
, O
and O
it O
has O
really O
superseded O
my O
high O
expectations O
. O

also O
, O
the O
sound O
quality O
from O
the O
speakers O
is O
crystal O
clear O
, O
and O
everything O
is O
just O
sleek O
and O
smooth O
. O

the O
hd O
display O
is O
sensational O
, O
and O
now O
watching O
any O
movie O
is O
a O
very O
enjoyable O
experience O
for O
me O
. O

no O
hardware O
issues O
, O
as O
is O
common O
with O
any O
apple O
product O
. O

great O
product O
, O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
with O
it O
. O

awesome O
laptop O
, O
i O
love O
it O

i O
love O
my O
new O
thinkpad O
! O

it O
gives O
me O
everything O
i O
need O
from O
a O
computer O
and O
with O
the O
long O
lasting O
battery O
, O
it O
also O
gives O
me O
mobility O
. O

i O
can O
use O
it O
anywhere O
. O

it O
was O
a O
great O
purchase O
. O

all O
the O
sturdy O
and O
substantial O
feel O
you O
expect O
from O
a O
thinkpad O
. O

average O
performance O
on O
almost O
every O
benchmark O
but O
priced O
accordingly O
. O

below O
average O
on O
the O
w-fi O
adapter O
which O
i O
'm O
still O
trying O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
. O

if O
the O
wi-fi O
adapter O
will O
not O
support O
duplex O
operation O
( O
still O
trying O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
that O
) O
that O
's O
a O
noticeable O
drawback O
i O
'll O
be O
grousing O
about O
for O
the O
entire O
time O
i O
use O
it O
. O

great O
laptop O
. O

fast O
. O

works O
very O
well O
. O

would O
purchase O
again O
. O

a O
good O
value O
for O
the O
money O
. O

quite O
pleased O
with O
it O
. O

fast O
enough O
for O
my O
purposes O
. O

no O
bloatware O
from O
third O
party O
parasites O
to O
uninstall O
. O

excellent O
keyboard O
and O
crisp O
screen O
. O

battery O
could O
be O
better O
but O
it O
has O
robust O
processor O
and O
plenty O
of O
ram O
so O
that O
is O
a O
trade O
off O
i O
suppose O
. O

i O
'm O
glad O
to O
have O
it O
and O
it O
showed O
up O
in O
only O
a O
few O
days O
. O

the O
laptop O
itself O
is O
very O
good O
, O
it O
could O
be O
better O
, O
but O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
for O
it O
's O
price O
point O
. O

it O
does O
everything O
i O
need O
. O

the O
big O
deal O
with O
this O
was O
windows O
7 O
. O

i O
had O
searched O
everywhere O
for O
a O
windows O
7 O
laptop O
, O
and O
all O
i O
could O
find O
was O
that O
awful O
windows O
8 O
. O

when O
i O
saw O
this O
i O
grabbed O
it O
. O

it O
has O
met O
all O
my O
needs O
. O

just O
what O
i O
expected O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
complains O
about O
this O
computer O

outstanding O
laptop O
and O
very O
well O
built O
. O

this O
unit O
will O
replace O
my O
old O
desktop O
. O

the O
retina O
display O
is O
fantastic O
. O

one O
of O
the O
best O
thing O
i O
have O
bought O
in O
years O
. O

great O
pc O
, O
light O
and O
powerful O
. O

is O
just O
amazing.= O
) O

the O
glare O
of O
the O
glossy-retina O
display O
is O
unbearable O
. O

do O
not O
buy O
a O
mac O
until O
this O
issue O
is O
resolved O
. O

performs O
as O
advertised O
, O
if O
not O
better O
! O

super O
light O
weight O
( O
i O
never O
cared O
either O
way O
about O
weight O
until O
now O
) O
. O

feels O
like O
solid O
state O
. O

wonderful O
machine O
; O

glad O
i O
bought O
it O
. O

tiny O
, O
forgivable O
drawback O
- O
no O
ethernet O
cable O
outlet O
. O

but O
that O
's O
not O
a O
deal-breaker O
. O

super O
laptop O
! O
! O

will O
probably O
get O
another O
one O
for O
my O
wife O
! O

a O
bit O
ugly O
, O
but O
works O
good O

i O
like O
the O
design O
rather O
sleek O
and O
light O
. O

i O
will O
give O
advise O
any O
prospective O
buyers O
this O
is O
not O
great O
laptop O
, O
its O
good O
for O
web O
browsing O
and O
word O
processing O

fantastic O
for O
the O
price O
- O
just O
wish O
it O
the O
keys O
were O
illuminated O
. O

if O
your O
on O
a O
budget O
... O
. O
save O
up O
longer O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
n't O
worth O
a O
single O
cent O
. O

i O
could O
n't O
even O
install O
linux O
on O
it O
. O

windows O
runs O
very O
poorly O
. O

just O
save O
your O
money O
and O
get O
something O
better O
. O

awesome O
price O
for O
a O
laptop O
that O
lasts O
more O
than O
8 O
hours O
without O
recharging O
! O

are O
u O
serious O
? O

awesome O
! O

this O
laptop O
is O
a O
complete O
cheap O
junk O
. O

by O
just O
looking O
at O
it O
you O
will O
realize O
it O
's O
crap O
. O

it O
's O
not O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

the O
case O
is O
made O
from O
cheap O
plastic O
. O

in O
the O
description O
it O
said O
there O
is O
bluetooth O
but O
no O
there O
is O
n't O
. O

i O
'm O
warning O
you O
, O
you O
're O
wasting O
your O
money O
on O
this O

love O
the O
computer O
. O

hate O
windows O
8.1 O
! O

it O
dos O
n't O
even O
have O
a O
disc O
compartment O

had O
to O
return O
the O
computer O
. O

keeps O
freezing O

no O
ethernet O
outlet O

disc O
drive O
will O
not O
open O
or O
function O

odd O
- O
unusual O
dell O
commands O

would O
have O
exchanged O
instantly O
- O
but O
had O
to O
use O
as O
if O
for O
college O
immediately O
. O

unimpressed O
. O

terrific O
laptop O
. O

works O
beautifully O
. O

great O
price O
. O

just O
what O
we O
needed O
for O
our O
daughter O
to O
do O
her O
on O
line O
math O
class O

this O
is O
a O
great O
home O
computer O
. O

it O
is O
very O
, O
very O
quiet O
. O

the O
only O
reason O
i O
did O
n't O
give O
it O
a O
5 O
star O
is O
, O
i O
feel O
i O
have O
to O
reach O
so O
far O
to O
type O
on O
the O
key O
board O
. O

you O
also O
have O
to O
press O
firmly O
on O
the O
keys O
. O

otherwise O
this O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
great O
prices O
. O

was O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
and O
has O
been O
easy O
to O
learn O
to O
use O
it O
. O

works O
good O
and O
is O
fast O
enough O
for O
me O
. O

good O
product O
for O
a O
good O
price O
. O

it O
was O
too O
cheaply O
constructed O
. O

it O
also O
gave O
me O
an O
introduction O
to O
windows O
8 O
, O
which O
i O
hope O
will O
be O
discontinued O
it O
the O
future O
. O

the O
computer O
is O
horrible O
its O
to O
slow O
. O

the O
thing O
that O
you O
insert O
cds O
into O
wo O
n't O
open O
. O

i O
wo O
n't O
ever O
buy O
a O
computer O
off O
amazon O
again O
that O
's O
for O
sure O
! O

not O
a O
good O
computer O
at O
all O
. O

we O
returned O
two O
days O
later O
. O

they O
were O
excellent O
to O
handle O
our O
return O
and O
post O
our O
refund O
back O
into O
our O
account O
the O
next O
day O
. O

thank O
you O
! O

great O
price O
and O
computer O
! O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
computer O
for O
my O
parents O
, O
they O
only O
access O
their O
facebook O
and O
e-mail O
accounts O
, O
see O
family O
pictures O
, O
etc O
. O

they O
loved O
it O
. O

it O
's O
easy O
to O
operate O
and O
it O
's O
very O
light O
( O
my O
parents O
are O
almost O
60 O
yo O
, O
they O
ca O
n't O
carry O
a O
heavy O
computer O
while O
traveling O
) O
. O

but O
here O
's O
something O
i O
had O
n't O
realized O
before O
buying O
it O
: O
there O
is O
n't O
an O
optical O
drive O
, O
which O
means O
no O
cds O
or O
dvds O
! O

this O
product O
was O
doa O
. O

fired O
up O
and O
worked O
for O
the O
first O
day O
and O
then O
the O
display O
died O
on O
my O
wife O
while O
she O
was O
taking O
a O
timed O
test O
. O

would O
not O
recommend O
. O

pretty O
good O
laptop O
. O

good O
for O
basic O
stuff O
. O

do O
n't O
try O
to O
use O
to O
play O
any O
pc O
games O
or O
anything O
. O

just O
for O
simple O
web O
browsing O
and O
media O
streaming O
. O

pretty O
premium O
feel O
for O
the O
low O
price O
. O

i O
have O
so O
much O
trouble O
turning O
the O
computer O
on O
. O

it O
comes O
on O
for O
seconds O
then O
shuts O
itself O
off O
. O

my O
mistake O
was O
to O
not O
research O
this O
one O
, O
no O
dvd O
and O
no O
place O
to O
insert O
my O
ad O
card O
to O
download O
pictures O
. O

i O
was O
in O
a O
big O
hurry O
to O
buy O
a O
computer O
just O
to O
produce O
a O
newsletter O
for O
my O
job O
. O

i O
should O
have O
waited O
to O
find O
a O
higher O
quality O
computer O
. O

i O
'm O
very O
happy O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
beatifull O
, O
is'nt O
slow O
at O
all O
. O

but O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
cd O
unit O
, O
anyway O
the O
other O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
laptop O
does O
not O
have O
an O
ethernet O
port O
for O
cable O
connecting O
. O

just O
wifi O
... O
. O

the O
screen O
is O
big O
, O
and O
everything O
was O
as O
described O

for O
everyday O
use O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
really O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

if O
, O
like O
me O
, O
you O
will O
be O
paying O
bills O
, O
occasionally O
reading O
the O
news O
, O
or O
just O
buying O
stuff O
on O
line O
, O
then O
this O
is O
a O
winner O
. O

if O
you O
are O
a O
gamer O
or O
need O
it O
for O
heavy O
computer O
use O
, O
get O
something O
else O
. O

it O
's O
a O
good O
starter O
computer O
that O
is O
extremely O
light O
on O
the O
wallet O
. O

like O
i O
said O
, O
good O
for O
basic O
stuff O
and O
as O
a O
starter O
. O

still O
getting O
use O
to O
window O
8 O
. O

has O
a O
built O
in O
camera O
which O
i O
do O
not O
use O
. O

sturdy O
but O
only O
for O
typical O
wear O
and O
tear O
. O

can O
not O
believe O
the O
price O
! O

amazing O
computer O

school O
. O

had O
my O

little O
over O
a O
month O
now O
and O
it O
does O
everything O
i O
want O
it O
to O
do O
and O
more O
. O

i O
really O
have O
nothing O
negative O
to O
say O
about O
it O
. O

the O
keyboard O
is O
a O
little O
wonky O
with O
having O
to O
use O
the O
function O
button O
to O
get O
the O
f-keys O
but O
with O
how O
infrequently O
i O
use O
those O
it O
is O
a O
non-issue O
. O

it O
is O
a O
great O
value O
for O
what O
you O
get O
. O

i O
can O
run O
somewhat O
modern O
games O
like O
skyrim O
and O
fallout O
new O
vegas O
with O
no O
issues O
. O

i O
get O
giddy O
every O
time O
i O
use O
this O
thing O
. O

it O
is O
a O
thing O
of O
beauty O
and O
fast O
enough O
. O

what O
's O
fast O
enough O
? O

when O
you O
click O
and O
do O
n't O
wait O
. O

waiting O
is O
horrible O
, O
and O
not O
waiting O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
on O
earth O
. O

so O
yes O
, O
it O
is O
ridiculously O
fast O
. O

the O
battery O
will O
get O
you O
from O
la O
to O
ny O

for O

for O
the O

a O
super O
product O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

it O
wont O
wow O

$ O
249 O
. O

plus O
this O
computer O
comes O
with O
a O
full O
size O
keyboard O
. O

no O
junkware O
! O
! O

this O
computer O
is O
great O
for O
someone O
who O
is O
looking O
to O
manage O
their O
online O
life O
( O
banling O
, O
facebook O
etc O
) O
and O
some O
basic O
offline O
work O
using O
ms O
office O
. O

the O
only O
drawback O
is O
no O

but O
for O
$ O
20 O
you O
can O
buy O
an O
external O

not O
bad O
. O

nice O
and O
light O
, O

help O
your O
work O
instead O
of O
becoming O
work O
itself O
. O

perfect O
size O
for O
me O
. O

probably O
not O
a O
gaming O
machine O
, O
which O
i O
have O
zero O
interest O
in O
. O

i O
just O
love O
this O
ultrabook O

i O
defenitly O
recommend O
it O
for O
anyone O
for O
office O
and O
home O
work O

it O
's O
ok O
. O

i O
find O
that O
it O
often O
gets O
very O
slow O
and O
i O
have O
to O
restart O
more O
than O
usual O
. O

it O
's O
light O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
though O
. O

i O
love O
this O
computer O
, O
this O
is O
my O
first O
ever O
mac O
( O
i O
'm O
21 O
) O
and O
it O
took O
a O
little O
while O
to O
switch O
over O
from O
the O
os O
i O
was O
used O
to O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fast O
learning O
curve O
. O

the O
resolution O
is O
gorgeous O
, O
the O
computer O
is O
light O
, O
it O
does O
everything O
i O
need O
and O
the O
interface O
is O
pretty O
intuitive O
. O

i O
love O
this O
computer O
! O

however O
i O
am O
very O
upset O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
superdrive O
built O
in O
! O

supper O
east O
to O
use O
. O

retina O

beautiful O
. O

also O
very O
quick O
laptop O
! O

con O
: O

the O

even O
with O

like O

for O
a O
good O
half O
of O
the O
day O
. O

overall O
, O
the O

at O
my O
age O

i O
need O
this O
kind O
of O

extremely O
slow O

a O
masterpiece O
of O

slow O
processor O
, O
just O
not O
it O

i O
upgraded O
the O

found O
the O
user O
manual O
( O
which O
i O
read O
while O
awaiting O
the O
laptop O
to O
arrive O
) O
more O
useful O
than O
the O

i O
ca O
n't O
use O
the O
trackpad O
very O
well O
, O
it O

hooked O
up O

general O
, O
a O

the O

my O
desktop O
unit O

it O

not O
a O
small O
, O
compact O
laptop O
, O
but O
i O
wo O
n't O
be O
traveling O
via O

often O
, O
so O
its O
size O
and O
weight O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
for O
me O
. O

this O
was O
recommended O
to O
me O
by O
an O
it O

specialist O
in O
the O
local O
school O

. O

i O
can O

if O
you O
are O
undecided O
between O
a O
desktop O
or O
laptop O
pc O
, O
i O
strongly O
recommend O
this O
pc O
as O
a O
solution O
. O

do O
n't O
expect O
much O
in O
terms O
of O
performance O
from O
this O
laptop O
. O

it O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
in O
terms O
of O
having O
a O
computer O
that O
can O
browse O
the O
web O
, O
use O
word O
/ O
excel O
, O
and O
the O
like O
. O

this O
laptop O
does O
not O
have O
an O
rj-45 O
ethernet O
adapter O
for O
wired O
network O
connection O
. O

fast O
easy O

i O
live O
in O
jamaica O
and O
bought O
this O
online O
and O
my O
husband O
took O
it O
down O
for O
me O
. O

so O
far O
i O
do O
not O
have O
any O
trouble O
with O
it O
other O
than O
the O
picture O
quality O
is O
a O
bit O
poor O
. O

my O
son O
saw O
this O
laptop O
online O
and O
told O
be O
about O
it O
and O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
good O
deal O
and O
bought O
it O
. O

i O
have O
had O
it O
over O
a O
month O
now O
and O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

this O
laptop O
suits O
my O
needs O
: O
as O
i O
am O
currently O
studying O
online O
and O
just O
need O
a O
computer O
for O
that O
purpose O
. O

my O
daughter O
uses O
it O
for O
college O
too O
and O
it O
works O
great O
for O
both O
of O
us O
. O

so O
i O
gave O
this O
4 O
stars O
but O
only O
because O
of O
the O
poor O
picture O
quality O
, O
other O
than O
that O
it O
is O
a O
great O
buy O
! O

this O
laptop O
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
. O

i O
bought O
it O
simply O
for O
excel O
on O
windows O
for O
work O
since O
i O
have O
a O
macbook O
air O
and O
literally O
the O
thing O
freezes O
and O
lags O
opening O
excel O
or O
my O
web O
browser O
. O

there O
is O
a O
chance O
mine O
is O
defective O
but O
regardless O
i O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
try O
another O
one O
this O
is O
a O
terrible O
product O
. O

i O
'd O
much O
rather O
bite O
the O
bullet O
and O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
for O
a O
product O
that O
actually O
meets O
minimum O
computing O
expectations O
for O
2014 O
. O

i O
appreciate O
the O
effort O
to O
hit O
affordable O
pricing O
dell O
but O
just O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

it O
is O
slow O
and O
complicated O
and O
very O
disappointing O

great O
labtop.. O

not O
as O
fast O
as O
i O
would O
have O
liked O
it O
to O
be O
but O
everything O

great O
! O

i O

only O
had O
this O

a O
few O
days O
an O
i O
already O

the O

is O
just O
a O
dud O

operating O
system O
, O
and O
hardware O
of O
this O
mac O
are O
great O
. O

more O
than O
enough O
for O
my O
use O
. O

the O
display O
is O
vibrant O
and O
clear O
, O
the O
keyboard O
is O
well O
designed O
and O
pleasant O
to O
type O
on O
; O

i O
even O
installed O
a O
windows O
partition O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
windows O
software O
. O

things O
just O
work O
, O
they O
are O
fluid O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
understand O
, O
fast O
and O
work O
well O
. O

this O
computer O
is O
absolutely O
perfect O
for O
web O
browsing O
, O
watching O
video O
, O
word O
processing O
, O
and O
that O
's O
about O
it O
. O

if O
you O
want O
a O
computer O
that O
plays O
games O
or O
any O
advanced O
tasks O
like O
editing O
video O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
not O
for O
you O
. O

now O
when O
i O
say O
do O
n't O
expect O
to O
play O
games O
on O
it O
, O
i O
mean O
it O
. O

pretty O
much O
every O
major O
game O
save O
for O
solitare O
wo O
n't O
even O
play O
on O
it O
due O
to O
the O
slower O
processor O
. O

its O
also O
worth O
noting O
that O
there O
no O
bluetooth O
, O
no O
mircophone O
jack O
, O
no O
ethernet O
, O
no O
dvd O
/ O
cd O
drive O
/ O
burner O
, O
and O
no O
usb O
3.0 O
ports O
. O

it O
does O
come O
with O
two O
usb O
2.0 O
ports O
, O
a O
hdmi O
port O
, O
and O
a O
webcam O
. O

the O
webcam O
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
its O
there O
if O
you O
need O
it O
. O

do O
n't O
expect O
it O
to O
take O
good O
pictures O
or O
video O
. O

the O
battery O
is O
pretty O
soild O
. O

it O
lasts O
up O
to O
5-6 O
hours O
with O
normal O
use O
. O

the O
computer O
itself O
runs O
very O
quiet O
and O
is O
mostly O
cool O
to O
the O
touch O
. O

the O
only O
major O
negative O
to O
me O
is O
windows O
8.1 O
( O
though O
ymmv O
) O
and O
the O
dell O
crapware O
installed O
. O

i O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
to O
remove O
it O
and O
install O
windows O
7 O
on O
it O
with O
a O
usb O
drive O
. O

the O
performance O
will O
improve O
on O
it O
. O

trust O
me O
. O

not O
bad O
for O
the O
price O
. O

i O
needed O
an O
inexpensive O
laptop O
to O
do O
basic O
office O
work O
on O
that O
was O
lightweight O
and O
this O
fits O
the O
bill O
just O
fine O
. O

performance O
wise O
, O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
that O
's O
to O
be O
expected O
from O
a O
celeron-class O
processor O
. O

i O
'm O
also O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
windows O
8 O
, O
but O
fortunately O
i O
can O
install O
whatever O
i O
want O
on O
the O
laptop O
without O
issue O
. O

love O
everything O
about O
this O
laptop O
! O

sound O
, O
quality O
and O
touchscreen O
are O
awesome O
! O

i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
! O
! O

i O
love O
this O
laptop O
to O
the O
moon O
. O

my O
favorite O
colors O
black O
and O
red O
, O
the O
matte O
material O
and O
the O
red O
backlight O
of O
the O
keyboard O
. O

the O
sound O
is O
great O
and O
it O
's O
fast O
. O

i O
had O
a O
number O
of O
updates O
to O
do O
and O
customization O
. O

the O
laptop O
is O
beautiful O
, O
not O
extremely O
light O
but O
thin O
enough O
and O
wide O
screen O
with O
a O
full O
keyboard O
. O

the O
touch O
screen O
response O
is O
fast O
and O
it O
picks O
up O
bluetooth O
and O
wifi O
fast O
. O

microsoft O
office O
is O
a O
30 O
day O
trial O
, O
a O
number O
of O
games O
and O
apps O
are O
already O
preloaded O
. O

it O
's O
exactly O
like O
the O
picture O
and O
i O
am O
satisfied O
. O

great O
laptop O
light O
and O
very O
versatile O

it O
was O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
. O

i O
like O
the O
number O
pad O
for O
work O
so O
that O
's O
nice O

this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
random O
and O
unorganized O
, O
but O
here O
are O
my O
thoughts O
on O
the O
laptop O
: O
so O
far O
so O
good O
after O
a O
month O
. O

it O
took O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
on O
the O
widows O
8.1 O
, O
after O
being O
an O
xp O
user O
for O
many O
years O
. O

everything O
seems O
to O
be O
running O
smoothly O
. O

only O
downfall O
is O
the O
preloaded O
mcafee O
and O
other O
software O
. O

they O
are O
fine O
while O
the O
free O
subscription O
is O
going O
, O
but O
a O
pain O
when O
they O
start O
asking O
you O
to O
spend O
money O
every O
time O
you O
login O
. O

device O
is O
light O
weight O
, O
quiet O
during O
operation O
and O
produces O
little O
to O
no O
heat O
. O

it O
has O
a O
quick O
start O
up O
and O
shut O
down O
time O
. O

the O
display O
is O
good O
quality O
. O

just O
wish O
there O
were O
more O
usb O
ports O
. O

i O
am O
impressed O
with O
this O
computer O
, O
inexpensive O
but O
quality O
. O

love O
the O
size O
, O
i O
am O
using O
this O
for O
work O
, O
i O
am O
a O
nurse O
and O
have O
to O
chart O
daily O
, O
this O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
i O
have O
not O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

it O
's O
so O
damn O
good O
i O
bought O
2 O
: O
d O

if O
you O
're O
the O
type O
of O
person O
that O
just O
likes O
to O
browse O
the O
internet O
and O
enjoy O
media O
and O
do O
light O
work O
with O
microsoft O
office O
, O
this O
is O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
. O

do O
n't O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
a O
champion O
performer O
so O
if O
you O
want O
to O
play O
games O
or O
whatever O
this O
is O
not O
the O
computer O
for O
you O
. O

it O
's O
extremely O
light O
weight O
and O
slim O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
optical O
drive O
( O
who O
uses O
those O
anymore O
anyways O
) O
so O
it O
easily O
fits O
into O
any O
college O
students O
bag O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
who O
does O
n't O
need O
much O
out O
of O
a O
computer O
. O

bought O
a O
spare O
one O
for O
college O
and O
one O
for O
my O
mom O
: O
d O

happy O
shopping O
guys O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
computer O
. O

it O
is O
exactly O
what O
i O
expected O
, O
and O
the O
price O
is O
excellent O
! O

you O
are O
getting O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
it O
is O
worth O
more O
. O

been O
using O
it O
for O
about O
4 O
hours O
now O
and O
it O
seems O
plenty O
fast O
and O
does O
everything O
i O
need O
it O
to O
do O
. O

its O
a O
very O
basic O
laptop O
. O

i O
thought O
it O
would O
have O
a O
cd-rom O
drive O
, O
but O
there O
isnt O
one O
. O

also O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
port O
to O
plug O
an O
internet O
cord O
into O
it O
because O
sometimes O
my O
wifi O
router O
likes O
to O
not O
work O
. O

but O
for O
the O
price O
its O
good O
. O

other O
than O
the O
slow O
cpu O
it O
works O
great O
for O
everyday O
use O
. O

heavy O
gaming O
is O
definitely O
not O
it O
's O
strong O
point O
. O

the O
cover O
is O
a O
soft O
rubber O
texture O
without O
the O
friction O
. O

slick O
design O
and O
looks O
great O
. O

the O
machine O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
has O
the O
power O
it O
needs O
for O
personal O
use O
and O
some O
light O
professional O
work O
. O

it O
could O
be O
lighter O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
everything O
. O

the O
battery O
seems O
adequate O
for O
most O
uses O
~ O
4.5 O
hour O
use O
/ O
charge O
. O

screen O
is O
clear O
and O
bright O
. O

glad O
it O
has O
the O
dvd O
drive O
. O

perfectly O
adequate O
. O

great O
pc O
. O

the O
i7 O
is O
incredibly O
fast O
, O
the O
ram O
makes O
it O
proper O
for O
several O
games O
( O
not O
on O
maximum O
quality O
) O
. O

great O
sound O
quality O
too O
. O

nice O
laptop O
. O

i O
use O
it O
for O
school O
, O
its O
quick O
and O
has O
everything O
i O
need O
on O
it O
. O

good O
battery O
life O
as O
well O
. O

wifi O
card O
not O
working O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

dealing O
with O
hp O
support O
is O
a O
ridiculous O
and O
painful O
experience O
. O

i O
have O
spent O
more O
than O
2.5 O
hours O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
them O
( O
over O
4 O
different O
calls O
) O
, O
only O
to O
get O
no O
where O
. O

now O
i O
'm O
looking O
into O
the O
return O
process O
, O
which O
i O
'm O
sure O
will O
just O
be O
loads O
of O
fun O
, O
if O
my O
prior O
experience O
is O
any O
indication O
. O

seriously O
, O
save O
yourself O
the O
hassle O
and O
purchase O
from O
a O
different O
company O
. O

used O
to O
love O
hp O
products O
, O
but O
this O
has O
soured O
me O
on O
the O
whole O
company O
. O

by O
far O
the O
best O
laptop O
i O
've O
ever O
had O
. O

its O
fast O
, O
powerful O
, O
screen O
display O
is O
top O
notch O
and O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
excellent O
for O
a O
laptop O
of O
this O
size O
. O

my O
only O
concern O
is O
that O
since O
the O
battery O
is O
not O
external O
, O
i O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
change O
it O
out O
once O
it O
starts O
not O
to O
hold O
a O
good O
charge O
over O
a O
length O
of O
time O
. O

i O
wonder O
if O
thats O
just O
apples O
way O
of O
saying O
its O
time O
to O
get O
the O
newest O
and O
greatest O
laptop O
3-4 O
years O
from O
now O
lol O
. O

the O
product O
is O
average O
and O
works O
well O
. O

works O
at O
a O
decent O
speed O
. O

the O
mouse O
pad O
however O
is O
very O
loud O
which O
is O
why O
i O
gave O
it O
four O
stars O
. O

i O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
purchasing O
my O
dell O
inspiron O
i3531-1200bk O
15.6-inch O
laptop O
. O

i O
was O
very O
impressed O
by O
the O
sellers O
speedy O
two-day O
delivery O
, O
which O
was O
free O
! O

my O
laptop O
was O
easy O
to O
set-up O
, O
and O
i O
've O
had O
no O
problems O
to O
date O
. O

thank O
you O
! O

did O
not O
disappoint O
me O
at O
all O
. O

lenovo O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
. O

built O
in O
mike O
is O
really O
poor O
and O
unusable O
for O
skype O
or O
any O
other O
purpose O
. O

and O
the O
only O
microphone O
input O
is O
for O
a O
combo O
mike O
/ O
speaker O
plug O
. O

so O
to O
communicate O
i O
need O
to O
wear O
ear O
plugs O
or O
a O
headset O
with O
a O
built-in O
mike O
. O

that O
's O
a O
nuisance O
for O
family O
skype O
calls O
... O
only O
one O
can O
speak O
at O
a O
time O
. O

we O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
enough O
or O
had O
it O
long O
enough O
to O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
, O
but O
so O
far O
it O
has O
been O
a O
very O
good O
laptop O
. O

several O
other O
reviewers O
made O
comments O
on O
the O
keyboard O
and O
now O
i O
can O
understand O
why O
-- O
- O
this O
keyboard O
is O
the O
nicest O
to O
use O
of O
any O
laptop O
we O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O

i O
'm O
a O
life-long O
desktop O
computer O
user O
, O
and O
the O
keyboard O
on O
this O
laptop O
is O
as O
close O
to O
a O
`` O
normal O
'' O
keyboard O
as O
i O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

we O
like O
this O
new O
laptop O
-- O
a O
lot O
! O

very O
good O
performer O
for O
the O
price O
. O

not O
blazing O
fast O
, O
but O
quick O
enough O
. O

one O
really O
nice O
thing O
about O
lenovo O
laptops O
is O
that O
they O
are O
not O
cluttered O
with O
a O
bunch O
or O
trial O
software O
. O

the O
desktop O
was O
clean O
once O
i O
got O
it O
up O
and O
running O
. O

battery O
life O
is O
above O
average O
, O
and O
it O
charges O
quickly O
. O

keyboard O
is O
sturdy O
. O

the O
touch O
pad O
takes O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
as O
the O
`` O
click O
'' O
buttons O
are O
on O
top O
instead O
of O
the O
bottom O
. O

i O
will O
be O
considering O
lenovo O
for O
all O
future O
laptop O
purchases O
. O

this O
lap O
top O
is O
good O
so O
far O
. O

it O
is O
quiet O
runs O
smoothly O
. O

i O
really O
like O
the O
video O
option O
on O
it O
, O
i O
stream O
movies O
on O
amazon O
prime O
and O
netflix O
and O
there O
is O
no O
lag O
. O

actually O
streams O
better O
than O
my O
regular O
desk O
top O
computer O
. O

the O
only O
negative O
would O
be O
that O
it O
gets O
pretty O
warm O
sitting O
on O
my O
lap O
for O
very O
long O
, O
but O
that O
is O
pretty O
much O
standard O
for O
all O
lop O
tops O
i O
think O
. O

now O
i O
lay O
a O
pillow O
on O
my O
lap O
first O
. O

problem O
solved O
. O

ouch O
. O

it O
stopped O
working O
31 O
days O
after O
purchase O
. O

i O
just O
tried O
to O
restart O
it O
. O

i O
hope O
they O
can O
fix O
it O
somehow O
. O

it O
was O
slow O
and O
might O
be O
problematic O
. O

i O
would O
shop O
around O
for O
a O
better O
one O
. O

crashed O
only O
2 O
days O
from O
getting O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O

says O
it O
is O
failing O
hard O
drive O
. O

going O
to O
see O
what O
lenovo O
does O
. O

i O
should O
have O
bought O
something O
better O
. O

the O
pc O
is O
works O
well O
with O
a O
good O
battery O
and O
a O
power O
cable O
, O
and O
has O
a O
web O
cam O
. O

however O
, O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
dvd O
drive O
, O
neither O
does O
it O
afford O
one O
the O
opportunity O
to O
connect O
an O
external O
dvd O
drive O
as O
the O
manufacturer O
did O
not O
make O
any O
point O
ofconnection O
of O
an O
external O
drive O
. O

got O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

other O
than O
a O
hate O
of O
windows O
8 O
, O
she O
just O
loves O
it O
. O

this O
is O
not O
my O
first O
dell O
laptop O
. O

i O
've O
owned O
other O
models O
, O
as O
well O
. O

this O
one O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
same O
quality O
as O
ones O
i O
have O
purchased O
before O
. O

the O
plastic O
materials O
are O
rather O
cheap O
. O

love O
it O
! O

needs O
more O
instructions O
with O
it O

i O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
acer O
, O
it O
does O
just O
for O
what O
i O
need O
it O
. O

even O
the O
sound O
is O
fantastic O

i O
love O
this O
laptop O
. O

even O
my O
extremely O
tech O
savvy O
boyfriend O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
features O
and O
sleek O
design O
. O

although O
i O
've O
had O
it O
for O
less O
than O
a O
week O
, O
i O
am O
very O
satisfied O
. O

functions O
well O
. O

does O
all O
that O
was O
advertised O
. O

if O
it O
had O
a O
4,5 O
star O
option O
, O
that O
is O
what O
i O
would O
give O
. O

the O
build O
is O
perfect O
, O
the O
screen O
fantastic O
, O
but O
i O
do O
have O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
i O
have O
to O
buy O
adaptors O
for O
nearly O
everything O
, O
from O
vga O
cables O
to O
ethernet O
cables O
, O
so O
, O
almost O
perfect O
... O

i O
just O
bought O
this O
laptop O
yesterday O
. O

this O
is O
how O
i O
feel O
about O
the O
laptop O
so O
far O
: O

1.great O
display O
. O

love O
the O
color O
accuracy O
. O

2.very O
decent O
speakers O
. O

3.fairly O
fast O
. O

4.loud O
fan O
when O
watching O
4k O
video O
off O
youtube O
. O

sounds O
like O
a O
washer O
. O

machine O
gets O
fairly O
hot O
near O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

5.best O
to O
use O
the O
power O
supply O
for O
4k O
video O
viewing O
. O

battery O
power O
laptop O
had O
difficulties O
computing O
. O

6.still O
feels O
too O
heavy O
to O
me O
. O

could O
lose O
another O
pound O
or O
two O
. O

7.expensive O
. O

paid O
close O
to O
$ O
2800 O
out O
the O
door O
. O

there O
are O
too O
many O
things O
to O
test O
. O

will O
update O
my O
review O
when O
i O
have O
time O
. O

biggest O
piece O
of O
junk O
i O
have O
ever O
purchased O
. O

bought O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
as O
a O
birthday O
present O
having O
owned O
a O
dell O
in O
the O
past O
which O
was O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

this O
clunker O
however O
stopped O
working O
after O
only O
two O
weeks O
of O
having O
it O
delivered O
. O

it O
would O
have O
a O
full O
charge O
yet O
would O
turn O
itself O
off O
for O
no O
explainable O
reason O
after O
being O
on O
for O
5 O
minutes O
. O

i O
promptly O
sent O
it O
back O
for O
an O
exchange O
thinking O
this O
was O
just O
a O
bad O
one O
and O
surely O
the O
next O
one O
would O
be O
fine O
. O

the O
second O
one O
, O
after O
a O
little O
over O
a O
month O
, O
refused O
to O
turn O
on O
even O
with O
a O
full O
charge O
. O

and O
i O
have O
pictures O
on O
there O
with O
no O
way O
to O
retrieve O
them O
! O

what O
a O
lemon O
! O
! O

this O
is O
a O
big O
disappointment O
. O

i O
only O
use O
a O
laptop O
for O
personal O
use O
, O
but O
this O
one O
ca O
n't O
even O
handle O
that O
! O

it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
load O
any O
page O
. O

i O
've O
had O
it O
for O
a O
minth O
and O
so O
far O
it O
's O
shut O
down O
completely O
3 O
times O
. O

had O
to O
call O
dell O
to O
get O
it O
back O
online O
. O

i O
have O
had O
dell O
desktops O
for O
years O
, O
so O
had O
no O
qualms O
about O
buying O
a O
dell O
laptop O
. O

never O
again O
. O

i O
've O
always O
sworn O
by O
dell O
. O

my O
very O
first O
laptop O
was O
a O
dell O
and O
it O
never O
failed O
me O
. O

it O
was O
stubborn O
as O
hell O
, O
no O
amount O
of O
dust O
or O
slipping O
to O
the O
ground O
phased O
it O
. O

it O
worked O
super O
fast O
and O
got O
the O
job O
done O
. O

so O
with O
this O
new O
order O
, O
all O
the O
upgrades O
and O
windows O
8 O
really O
caught O
my O
eye O
and O
i O
got O
this O
for O
the O
long O
haul O
. O

i O
am O
not O
ultra O
tech O
savvy O
but O
i O
can O
tell O
when O
it O
works O
slow O
! O

all O
i O
needed O
this O
for O
was O
to O
do O
some O
typing O
and O
simple O
internet O
browsing O
and O
maybe O
watching O
netflix O
here O
and O
there O
. O

i O
barely O
have O
any O
files O
or O
downloads O
and O
its O
almost O
impossible O
to O
get O
this O
thing O
to O
load O
. O

i O
know O
its O
not O
my O
internet O
connection O
because O
i O
have O
an O
hp O
as O
well O
and O
its O
like O
lightening O
even O
with O
the O
mass O
of O
data O
and O
info O
i O
have O
on O
it O
. O

i O
'm O
so O
disappointed O
. O

disclaimer O
: O
i O
'm O
a O
mac O
user O
. O

i O
wanted O
to O
love O
this O
laptop O
, O
which O
i O
bought O
as O
a O
transitional O
laptop O
to O
use O
between O
jobs O
, O
before O
my O
new O
university O
gave O
me O
one O
. O

in O
two O
months O
, O
both O
the O
power O
cord O
pin O
broke O
( O
the O
company O
replaced O
it O
) O
and O
then O
the O
cd O
drive O
literally O
jumped O
out O
of O
the O
laptop O
unannounced O
and O
shattered O
into O
a O
million O
pieces O
. O

in O
addition O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
i O
do O
to O
change O
the O
settings O
, O
add O
/ O
delete O
flash O
, O
etc. O
, O
firefox O
hangs O
on O
start-up O
. O

it O
seems O
like O
lenovo O
also O
makes O
weird O
choices O
about O
which O
side O
to O
put O
the O
powercord O
and O
other O
slots O
on O
. O

the O
cords O
always O
feel O
like O
they O
are O
in O
my O
way O
. O

one O
positive O
aspect O
of O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
keyboard O
, O
which O
is O
larger O
than O
usual O
. O

it O
's O
a O
pleasure O
to O
type O
on O
. O

my O
final O
thoughts O
: O
if O
you O
are O
a O
mac O
user O
, O
stay O
away O
. O

if O
you O
want O
to O
travel O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
do O
n't O
buy O
it O
. O

it O
's O
clunky O
, O
heavy O
, O
and O
a O
pain O
to O
start O
up O
and O
shut O
down O
. O

if O
you O
have O
zero O
dollars O
, O
consider O
it O
. O

if O
you O
want O
ease O
of O
use O
and O
long-term O
happiness O
, O
buy O
a O
macbook O
. O

great O
for O
games O

it O
's O
truly O
a O
great O
laptop O
for O
the O
price O
. O

i O
built O
my O
own O
gaming O
pc O
with O
a O
intel O
i5-4590 O
in O
it O
and O
a O
gtx O
760 O
so O
i O
know O
what O
crazy O
performance O
on O
a O
computer O
can O
come O
to O
. O

however O
, O
this O
laptop O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
when O
i O
bought O
it O
for O
college O
, O
i O
only O
use O
malwarebytes O
and O
microsoft O
security O
essentials O
, O
run O
a O
virus O
scan O
maybe O
once O
a O
week O
and O
it O
has O
ran O
smoother O
than O
butter O
for O
the O
past O
two O
years O
. O

for O
$ O
250 O
, O
which O
is O
as O
much O
as O
my O
graphics O
card O
alone O
cost O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
an O
incredible O
value O
. O

it O
is O
quite O
impressive O
at O
multitasking O
, O
which O
really O
surprised O
me O
. O

i O
can O
have O
tabs O
open O
while O
playing O
youtube O
videos O
and O
it O
handles O
it O
impressively O
well O
. O

but O
i O
should O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
laptop O
does O
not O
have O
the O
best O
screen O
, O
it O
's O
certainly O
good O
enough O
for O
the O
average O
person O
, O
but O
if O
you O
're O
used O
to O
good O
screens O
this O
may O
bother O
you O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
it O
's O
certainly O
not O
unbearable O
by O
anyone O
's O
standards O
. O

if O
you O
want O
to O
game O
, O
this O
thing O
can O
handle O
league O
of O
legends O
on O
medium-low O
settings O
, O
but O
i O
certainly O
would O
n't O
recommend O
it O
for O
gaming O
. O

overall O
, O
a O
great O
laptop O
for O
simply O
doing O
basic O
things O
and O
web-browsing O
. O

would O
definitely O
recommend O
for O
those O
who O
are O
`` O
technologically O
ignorant O
'' O

this O
computer O
is O
very O
slow O

i O
love O
this O
laptop O
! O

it O
does O
everything O
i O
need O
it O
too O
! O

very O
good O
price O
. O

very O
nice O
computer O

immediately O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
track O
buttons O
. O

they O
are O
loud O
and O
clunky O
but O
i O
figured O
i O
'd O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O

no O
need O
to O
. O

the O
laptop O
died O
two O
days O
after O
i O
received O
it O
. O

i O
purchased O
a O
dell O
inspiron O
i3531-1200bk O
and O
so O
far O
i O
love O
it O
, O
this O
model O
has O
a O
true O
life O
monitor O
, O
which O
is O
worth O
the O
extra O
bucks O
. O

if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
basic O
pc O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

the O
hinges O
on O
this O
pc O
are O
nice O
and O
tight O
and O
well O
made O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
pc O
. O

i O
was O
surprised O
at O
the O
overall O
quality O
and O
the O
price O

in O
all O
my O
life O
i O
have O
never O
come O
across O
a O
computer O
as O
slow O
as O
this O
one O
, O
it O
cant O
perform O
basic O
operations O
and O
is O
practically O
useless O
. O

i O
just O
received O
the O
laptop O
and O
if O
it O
runs O
like O
this O
already O
cant O
imagine O
how O
it O
would O
work O
in O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
weeks O
. O

it O
took O
almost O
20 O
minutes O
to O
boot O
up O
. O

please O
people O
dont O
make O
the O
same O
mistake O
i O
did O
. O

this O
is O
a O
complete O
waste O
of O
money O
, O
dont O
let O
the O
price O
fool O
you O
! O

would O
be O
a O
very O
nice O
laptop O
if O
the O
mousepad O
worked O
properly O
. O

it O
was O
not O
responsive O
at O
all O
to O
touch O
. O

very O
frustrating O
. O

and O
while O
tapping O
the O
mousepad O
to O
try O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work O
, O
your O
palm O
would O
inevitably O
touch O
the O
side O
which O
would O
pull O
up O
the O
side O
windows O
and O
block O
your O
ability O
to O
find O
the O
mouse O
. O

if O
they O
can O
fix O
this O
, O
i O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
very O
nice O
, O
cost-effective O
laptop O
. O

this O
laptop O
broke O
within O
the O
first O
hour O
of O
use O
. O

the O
'a O
' O
key O
became O
jammed O
so O
that O
sometimes O
it O
would O
n't O
press O
in O
. O

dell O
claims O
they O
test O
each O
key O
with O
thousands O
of O
mechanical O
key O
strokes O
. O

also O
, O
after O
restarting O
the O
laptop O
it O
constantly O
made O
high O
pitched O
electronic O
noises O
. O

i O
'm O
sure O
i O
just O
got O
a O
bad O
egg O
, O
but O
instead O
of O
getting O
a O
replacement O
i O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
different O
one O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
nice O
. O

it O
has O
a O
decent O
feel O
to O
it O
, O
sharp O
display O
and O
is O
fast O
enough O
. O

the O
biggest O
problem O
i O
have O
is O
the O
right O
side O
and O
top O
of O
the O
touchpad O
is O
unresponsive O
. O

so O
frustrating O
! O
! O

i O
have O
updated O
the O
drivers O
and O
tweeked O
every O
feature O
available O
, O
but O
nothing O
has O
helped O
. O

also O
, O
the O
touchpad O
is O
almost O
'sticky O
' O
, O
which O
kind O
of O
defeats O
the O
purpose O
of O
a O
touchpad O
. O

i O
would O
love O
to O
keep O
this O
laptop O
, O
but O
will O
be O
sending O
it O
back O
and O
looking O
for O
a O
different O
brand O
. O

no O
lenovo O
for O
me O
. O

initially O
i O
liked O
the O
product O
so O
much O
. O

although O
it O
was O
slow O
but O
i O
felt O
it O
was O
ok O
for O
the O
price O
you O
have O
bought O
it O
. O

but O
now O
i O
am O
having O
battery O
problems O
. O

laptop O
automatically O
shuts O
down O
when O
battery O
life O
reaches O
30 O
% O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
in O
november O
2013 O
. O

i O
am O
not O
satisfied O
with O
the O
product O
. O

it O
's O
an O
amazing O
laptop O
. O

most O
of O
the O
things O
about O
the O
laptop O
is O
awesome O
except O
the O
touchpad O
. O

the O
laptop O
is O
fast O
. O

the O
windows O
8.1 O
used O
to O
boot O
in O
just O
2s O
and O
that O
was O
freaking O
awesome O
. O

now O
i O
have O
dual O
booted O
my O
laptop O
to O
windows O
8.1 O
and O
ubuntu O
14.04 O
and O
it O
's O
not O
got O
too O
slow O
either O
. O

i O
am O
loving O
it O
completely O
. O

it O
does O
make O
a O
little O
noise O
but O
that O
's O
alright O
as O
it O
's O
not O
too O
much O
. O

it O
does O
n't O
get O
heated O
up O
much O
even O
after O
continuous O
usage O
. O

but O
the O
touchpad O
is O
soooooooooo O
big O
that O
whenever O
i O
am O
typing O
, O
my O
palm O
touches O
some O
part O
of O
it O
and O
then O
the O
cursor O
goes O
somewhere O
else O
and O
it O
's O
really O
annoying O
. O

i O
prefer O
typing O
without O
having O
to O
see O
the O
keyboard O
but O
due O
the O
large O
touchpad O
, O
i O
always O
have O
to O
type O
cautiously O
as O
my O
hand O
might O
take O
me O
somewhere O
else O
. O

hp O
please O
fix O
it O
. O

a O
smaller O
touchpad O
would O
make O
life O
easier O
for O
computer O
science O
students O
or O
it O
people O
much O
more O
easier O
. O

uhhhhhh O
, O
the O
computer O
looks O
good O
. O

but O
, O
it O
works O
really O
slowwwwww O
! O
! O
! O

it O
has O
got O
me O
feel O
like O
to O
take O
years O
to O
successfully O
open O
a O
web O
page O
. O

purchased O
it O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
love O
it O
! O

i O
've O
been O
a O
loyal O
dell O
user O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

but O
every O
six O
months O
my O
dell O
computer O
crashes O
. O

since O
i O
also O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
writing O
and O
illustrations O
using O
adobe O
products O
, O
i O
thought O
i O
would O
try O
a O
mac O
. O

i O
'm O
so O
glad O
that O
i O
have O
. O

it O
's O
been O
a O
very O
easy O
transition O
moving O
my O
windows O
created O
files O
over O
to O
the O
mac O
. O

so O
far O
i O
have O
n't O
lost O
any O
quality O
or O
information O
. O

i O
have O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
learning O
curve O
with O
the O
keyboard O
shortcuts O
. O

but O
other O
than O
that O
, O
i O
really O
am O
loving O
the O
quality O
and O
speed O
. O

expensive O
but O
worth O
it O
. O

the O
display O
has O
a O
great O
resolution O
but O
have O
difficulty O
always O
seeing O
the O
small O
print O
. O

have O
n't O
quite O
figured O
out O
how O
to O
make O
the O
font O
size O
larger O
overall O
. O

i O
'll O
keep O
trying O
however O
. O

this O
is O
without O
a O
doubt O
the O
worst O
laptop O
i O
've O
ever O
had O
. O

i O
wavered O
between O
another O
toshiba O
and O
this O
and O
ended O
up O
choosing O
this O
and O
i O
'm O
so O
sorry O
i O
did O
. O

and O
of O
course O
, O
the O
return O
window O
closed O
last O
week O
so O
now O
, O
i O
'm O
stuck O
with O
it O
. O

i O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
lenovo O
anything O
! O

unless O
you O
plan O
on O
using O
a O
mouse O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
do O
n't O
buy O
this O
. O

the O
touchpad O
has O
n't O
worked O
correctly O
since O
delivery O
though O
in O
the O
beginning O
, O
i O
thought O
perhaps O
it O
was O
just O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
quirk O
since O
most O
touchpads O
i O
've O
worked O
with O
have O
some O
inherent O
oddities O
. O

this O
one O
however O
, O
is O
now O
very O
loose O
and O
i O
have O
to O
either O
tap O
hard O
or O
repeatedly O
push O
to O
click O
in O
order O
for O
it O
to O
work O
, O
then O
suddenly O
, O
i O
can O
barely O
touch O
it O
at O
all O
and O
it O
clicks O
on O
its O
own O
. O

today O
, O
it O
has O
n't O
worked O
at O
all O
more O
than O
it O
has O
. O

the O
laptop O
has O
4g O
and O
a O
2.9g O
processor O
and O
it O
's O
slower O
than O
the O
four O
year O
old O
toshiba O
i O
replaced O
. O

it O
hangs O
, O
freezes O
and O
just O
is O
n't O
working O
properly O
. O

i O
have O
now O
been O
waiting O
almost O
a O
minute O
for O
the O
computer O
management O
window O
to O
open O
! O

though O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
much O
installed O
, O
i O
only O
have O
96 O
of O
the O
278g O
left O
! O

i O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
's O
taking O
up O
all O
the O
room O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
. O

most O
of O
my O
things O
are O
stored O
in O
the O
cloud O
. O

i O
could O
go O
on O
and O
on O
, O
but O
suffice O
it O
to O
say O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
$ O
400+ O
on O
a O
laptop O
, O
do O
n't O
buy O
this O
one O
! O

it O
's O
definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

very O
fast O
and O
good O
for O
most O
steam O
games O
. O

do O
n't O
expect O
great O
graphics O
, O
though O
. O

the O
keyboard O
and O
sound O
are O
great O
, O
and O
the O
matte O
screen O
works O
well O
. O

can O
run O
cs O
: O
go O
at O
60 O
fps O
on O
low O
settings O
. O

computer O
was O
doa O
. O

turned O
it O
on O
and O
it O
was O
beeping O
. O

looked O
up O
the O
manual O
on O
another O
computer O
. O

the O
manual O
said O
that O
particular O
series O
of O
beeps O
indicated O
a O
video O
problem O
. O

have O
the O
unit O
serviced O
. O

lenovo O
sent O
me O
a O
box O
to O
return O
it O
to O
them O
. O

they O
claim O
they O
will O
have O
it O
back O
in O
six O
working O
days O
. O

we O
'll O
see O
. O

once O
i O
get O
a O
working O
computer O
, O
i O
think O
i O
will O
like O
it O
. O

i O
've O
had O
lenovo O
computers O
before O
. O

i O
love O
this O
laptop O
. O

looks O
good O
, O
well O
built O
, O
and O
very O
good O
speed O
. O

needed O
a O
2 O
usb O
adapt O
. O
for O
network O
plug O
, O
no O
problem O
. O

keyboard O
is O
nice O
and O
windows O
8.1 O
is O
great O
, O
worried O
about O
that O
coming O
from O
xp O
. O

price O
makes O
this O
the O
laptop O
i O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

so O
far O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
computer O
. O

it O
has O
everything O
i O
wanted O
-- O
built O
in O
wi-fi O
connectibility O
, O
a O
slot O
for O
my O
sd O
camera O
memory O
card O
, O
a O
dvd O
burner O
, O
big O
beautiful O
screen O
, O
plenty O
of O
usb O
ports O
( O
three O
3.0 O
and O
one O
2.0 O
) O
, O
and O
a O
keyboard O
with O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O

i O
liked O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
came O
with O
windows O
7 O
, O
but O
also O
included O
windows O
8 O
to O
install O
later O
if O
i O
need O
it O
. O

the O
price O
was O
good O
. O

i O
use O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
, O
but O
the O
touch O
pad O
and O
the O
`` O
red O
button O
'' O
in O
the O
middle O
that O
works O
like O
a O
little O
`` O
joystick O
'' O
also O
work O
fine O
. O

i O
wish O
i O
had O
bought O
this O
sooner O
! O

this O
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

yes O
, O
it O
's O
running O
and O
old O
type O
processor O
so O
, O
hey O
, O
do O
n't O
even O
try O
gaming O
on O
it O
. O

but O
, O
if O
you O
are O
just O
an O
average O
user O
, O
it O
works O
really O
great O
. O

the O
screen O
is O
good O
, O
the O
whole O
things O
is O
very O
light O
and O
does O
n't O
run O
hot O
. O

i O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
, O
typing O
on O
it O
right O
now O
and O
it O
is O
fast O
enough O
for O
that O
! O

i O
like O
everything O
about O
this O
laptop O
. O

it O
has O
no O
way O
of O
connecting O
to O
the O
internet O
save O
wifi O
but O
that O
's O
all O
i O
use O
anyway O
! O

i O
put O
that O
free O
app O
on O
for O
word O
processing O
and O
it O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

i O
plugged O
it O
into O
my O
existing O
printers O
and O
it O
just O
worked O
, O
no O
fuss O
no O
muss O
. O

it O
immediately O
recognized O
the O
printer O
and O
was O
ready O
to O
go O
. O

excellent O
buy O
. O

the O
worst O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
laid O
my O
eyes O
upon O
. O

firstly O
, O
it O
has O
no O
leds O
to O
let O
you O
know O
what O
is O
going O
on O
, O
no O
cap O
lock O
, O
no O
hard O
drive O
indicator O
, O
nothing O
. O

ok O
, O
one O
light O
to O
let O
you O
know O
if O
the O
damn O
thing O
is O
on O
. O

the O
biggie O
though O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
disconnects O
from O
the O
internet O
whenever O
if O
feels O
like O
it O
, O
even O
when O
the O
strength O
bar O
is O
filled O
. O

also O
, O
when O
you O
try O
to O
download O
a O
large O
file O
, O
like O
a O
video O
, O
it O
will O
start O
out O
normally O
, O
downloading O
at O
around O
600kb O
/ O
sec O
and O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
will O
slow O
waaaaaay O
down O
to O
around O
20kb O
/ O
sec O
, O
making O
a O
download O
of O
a O
couple O
minutes O
into O
several O
hours O
making O
it O
worthless O
. O

get O
a O
probook O
instead O
. O

too O
often O
i O
would O
find O
it O
not O
being O
able O
to O
stay O
connected O
to O
the O
internet O
. O

i O
was O
unable O
to O
download O
itunes O
to O
it O
. O

dell O
support O
was O
awful O
to O
deal O
with O
. O

and O
the O
settings O
are O
simply O
annoying O
. O

just O
not O
for O
me O
. O

the O
computer O
is O
as O
expected O
, O
and O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

the O
8.1 O
windows O
is O
a O
major O
disappointment O
. O

operating O
a O
non O
touch O
screen O
on O
this O
system O
is O
a O
royal O
pain O
! O

was O
this O
computer O
refurbished O
? O

it O
came O
with O
no O
instruction O
book O
- O
no O
back O
up O
cd O
's O
and O
has O
already O
crashed O
. O

help O
! O

hands O
down O
one O
of O
my O
best O
and O
most O
used O
purchases O
thus O
far O
. O

the O
mid-2014 O
macbook O
pro O
does O
no O
disappoint O
... O

retina O
screen O
, O
solid O
build O
quality O
, O
weight O
, O
fast O
processor O
and O
the O
reliability O
of O
the O
apple O
brand O
. O

cons O
: O
honestly O
zero O
con O
's O
... O
as O
a O
windows O
pc O
user O
the O
switch O
over O
was O
seamlessly O
, O
i O
run O
parallel O
when O
i O
need O
windows O
. O

all O
my O
devices O
work O
flawlessly O
. O

i O
'm O
an O
amature O
, O
so O
this O
does O
more O
than O
i O
can O
handle O
. O

i O
'm O
perfectly O
satisfied O
, O
just O
have O
to O
get O
use O
to O
the O
new O
6.1 O
system O
i O
ca O
n't O
see O
a O
problem O
. O

i O
' O
doi9ng O
fine O
now O
, O
and O
happy O
as O
a O
bug O
. O

the O
price O
is O
great O
and O
it O
does O
everything O
i O
want O
to O
do O
, O
thanks O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
9 O
year O
old O
for O
a O
birthday O
gift O
. O

it O
's O
perfect O
! O

he O
uses O
to O
play O
mine O
craft O
and O
school O
work O
. O

it O
's O
great O
for O
what O
he O
uses O
it O
for O
. O

i O
am O
really O
not O
happy O
with O
this O
computer O
... O

the O
keyboard O
is O
not O
as O
easy O
to O
use O
as O
my O
old O
sony O
... O

i O
do O
n't O
like O
windows O
8 O
but O
that O
is O
no O
fault O
of O
the O
computer O
but O
the O
keyboard O
is O
so O
hard O
to O
get O
the O
keys O
to O
work O
and O
the O
space O
bar O
. O

would O
not O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

meh O
... O
but O
cheap O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
so O
that O
i O
could O
sit O
on O
the O
couch O
and O
surf O
internet O
with O
a O
larger O
screen O
than O
ipad O
was O
offering O
. O

the O
reviews O
at O
the O
time O
in O
late O
july O
2014 O
were O
mostly O
positive O
and O
it O
was O
the O
best O
selling O
laptop O
with O
almost O
4 O
star O
review O
... O

the O
first O
thing O
i O
can O
say O
for O
positive O
is O
that O
the O
laptop O
is O
very O
light- O
makes O
it O
really O
portable..this O
with O
a O
relatively O
clear O
screen O
is O
a O
bonus O
. O

now O
the O
graphics O
are O
not O
hd O
... O
and O
the O
reason O
that O
it O
is O
light O
is O
that O
it O
is O
really O
basic O
( O
medium O
low O
grade O
) O
plastic O
. O

so O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
kids O
, O
or O
not O
in O
high O
school O
or O
do O
n't O
accidently O
sit O
on O
it O
, O
it O
should O
be O
fine O
. O

now O
the O
speed O
is O
disappointing O
. O

start O
up O
is O
fine O
maybe O
20 O
secs O
at O
most O
, O
but O
then O
to O
get O
pages O
to O
load O
on O
internet O
is O
molasses O
at O
times O
. O

even O
for O
a O
4gb O
ram O
it O
barely O
chugs O
with O
3 O
tabs O
open O
. O

i O
tried O
all O
the O
window O
updates O
( O
this O
worked O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hp O
laptops O
i7in O
that O
i O
bought O
later O
at O
bb O
) O
to O
see O
if O
it O
could O
remove O
the O
drag O
, O
it O
did O
not O
. O

really O
at O
this O
point O
i O
am O
trying O
to O
confirm O
if O
the O
ram O
can O
be O
upgraded O
to O
see O
if O
i O
can O
do O
that O
to O
help O
. O

couple O
that O
with O
lack O
of O
inbuilt O
bluetooth O
, O
dvd O
drive O
you O
are O
looking O
at O
a O
close O
tie O
( O
or O
even O
a O
loss O
) O
compared O
with O
the O
other O
laptops O
on O
sale O
in O
mid O
to O
late O
august O
2014 O
. O

the O
hp O
laptops O
17in O
( O
with O
i3 O
core O
and O
amd O
) O
i O
mentioned O
before O
from O
the O
other O
big O
electronic O
bb O
store O
smoked O
this O
one O
even O
before O
i O
updated O
windows O
and O
upped O
the O
ram O
. O

but O
alas O
they O
were O
gifts O
... O
and O
what O
is O
a O
gift O
if O
not O
given O
? O

all O
in O
all O
i O
wish O
i O
had O
waited O
a O
bit O
. O

but O
then O
again O
hindsight O
is O
20/20 O
. O

bought O
a O
usb O
dvd O
rw O
drive O
but O
have O
not O
used O
it O
yet O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
amazing O
! O

windows O
8.1 O
has O
its O
pros O
and O
cons O
. O

the O
keyboard O
is O
backlit O
but O
you O
have O
to O
press O
the O
f5 O
key O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
. O

i O
was O
nervous O
at O
first O
that O
i O
purchased O
a O
lemon O
but O
the O
user O
manual O
explains O
how O
to O
turn O
on O
the O
keyboard O
backlight O
. O

of O
course O
this O
will O
decrease O
your O
battery O
life O
. O

the O
sound O
is O
very O
nice O
and O
crisp O
. O

also O
, O
i O
have O
no O
regrets O
about O
going O
with O
the O
8gb O
ram O
because O
its O
super O
fast O
. O

i O
'm O
still O
exploring O
the O
various O
features O
but O
overall O
i O
am O
satisfied O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

the O
hp O
envy O
15 O
has O
been O
everything O
i O
expected O
. O

after O
doing O
much O
research O
for O
a O
laptop O
that O
had O
all O
the O
features O
i O
was O
looking O
for O
, O
this O
one O
hit O
all O
the O
criteria O
i O
had O
. O

amazon O
had O
the O
best O
pricing O
and O
the O
delivery O
was O
on O
time O
. O

the O
laptop O
is O
very O
responsice O
with O
the O
core O
i7 O
processor O
and O
8gb O
of O
ram O
and O
the O
sound O
out O
of O
the O
beats O
audio O
is O
great O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
top O
performing O
laptop O
. O
