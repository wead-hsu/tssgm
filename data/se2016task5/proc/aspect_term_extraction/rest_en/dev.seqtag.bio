judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

we O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

they O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles O
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar O
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
. O

the O
food B
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B
tiny O
. O

after O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

avoid O
this O
place B
! O

i O
have O
eaten O
at O
saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

saul B
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
smith O
street O
and O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

the O
duck B
confit I
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B
gras I
terrine I
with I
figs I
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

the O
wine B
list I
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

for O
the O
price O
, O
you O
can O
not O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
manhattan O
. O

i O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant B
. O

ive O
asked O
a O
cart B
attendant I
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

i O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
ive O
requested O
. O

food B
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

chow B
fun I
was O
dry O
; O
pork B
shu I
mai I
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

i O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B
again O
. O

went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
fish B
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
i O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
o O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

service B
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

every O
time O
in O
new O
york O
i O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
restaurant B
saul I
on O
smith O
street O
. O

everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service B
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B
cool O
and O
understated O
. O

i O
had O
the O
duck B
breast I
special I
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

ca O
n't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

i O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
i O
will O
one O
day O
'give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
' O

and O
i O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
i O
doubt O
i O
'll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

the O
food B
is O
very O
average O
... O
the O
thai B
fusion I
stuff I
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
grilled B
chicken I
special I
with I
edamame I
puree I
. O

i O
had O
never O
had O
edamame B
pureed I
before O
but O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could O
've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

anyways O
, O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
, O
i O
would O
n't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
tamari O
. O

the O
decor B
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
really O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un-appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

we O
ate O
outside O
at O
haru O
's O
sake O
bar O
because O
haru O
's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

what O
's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

their O
sake B
list I
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
purple O
haze O
, O
which O
was O
n't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

the O
spicy B
tuna I
roll I
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B
shrimp I
tempura I
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

we O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B
was O
great O
! O

we O
love O
th O
pink B
pony I
. O

the O
perfect O
spot B
. O

food-awesome B
. O

service- B
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

ambiance- B
relaxed O
and O
stylish O
. O

do O
n't O
judge O
this O
place B
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

( O
i O
hang O
out O
, O
and O
live O
, O
in O
the O
neighborhood.. O
) O

the O
food B
is O
decent O
. O

however O
, O
it O
's O
the O
service B
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self-respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B
intimidate O
me O
, O
i.e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

well O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O
. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty O
. O
hmmm O
. O

this O
place B
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

i O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

food B
is O
great O
. O

service B
is O
top O
notch O
. O

i O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

i O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B
urchin I
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

it O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency-not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

the O
sushi B
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
. O

the O
rice B
to I
fish I
ration I
was O
also O
good O
-- O
they O
did O
n't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice O
. O

we O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B
price I
sushi I
deal I
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

i O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
i O
met O
recently O
. O

she O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

in O
the O
evening O
, O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
ny O
crowd B
. O

the O
food B
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B
impecable O
. O

i O
'm O
going O
back O
. O

having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
i O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
la O
lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

quite O
simply O
it O
's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

the O
service O
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food O
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
midtown O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced O
. O

the O
prix B
fixe I
menu I
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity O
and O
quality O
) O
. O

i O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O
! O

i O
've O
had O
the O
lunch O
buffet O
at O
chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
, O
when O
i O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

it O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

$ O
6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
food B
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O
. O

i O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B
were O
great O
. O

frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
, O
versus O
mcds O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

the O
food B
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

i O
like O
the O
somosas B
, O
chai B
, O
and O
the O
chole B
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B
and O
dhal B
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

the O
service B
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day- O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

the O
kitchen B
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B
spicy- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

the O
ambience B
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

if O
you O
've O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O
. O

add O
to O
that O
great O
service B
and O
great O
food B
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

the O
lava B
cake I
dessert I
was O
incredible O
and O
i O
recommend O
it O
. O

once O
you O
step O
into O
cosette B
, O
you O
're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off-the-beaten O
path O
parisian O
bistro O
. O

this O
tiny O
restaurant B
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
parisian O
flair O
. O

the O
food B
was O
average O
to O
above-average O
; O
the O
french B
onion I
soup I
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

however O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

i O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
i O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

it O
was O
horrible O
. O

the O
pizza B
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B
was O
n't O
even O
fully O
melted O
! O

it O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
nyc O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
. O

this O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

the O
pizza B
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients O
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B
right O
. O

a O
big O
disappointment O
, O
all O
around O
. O

i O
think O
i O
've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

the O
seafood B
is O
amazing O
, O
there O
's O
a O
good O
wine B
list I
, O
and O
the O
ever-changing O
menu B
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

the O
combination O
of O
super-fresh O
ingredients B
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

worth O
the O
trip O
from O
manhattan O
. O

was O
there O
friday O
night O
. O

best O
pastrami B
i O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

and O
i O
've O
been O
to O
many O
nyc O
delis O
. O

my O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B
shrimp I
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

as O
a O
japanese O
native O
, O
i O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
i O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place B
. O

this O
place B
is O
the O
most O
japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

the O
signs B
, O
the O
specials B
menus I
, O
food B
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B
are O
all O
totally O
japanese O
. O

this O
place B
is O
worth O
an O
one-hour O
drive O
. O

i O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
i O
can O
. O

leon B
is O
an O
east O
village O
gem O
: O
casual O
but O
hip O
, O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
french B
bistro I
fare I
, O
good O
specials B
, O
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere B
. O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young O
, O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly O
, O
staff B
, O
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O
. O

sit O
outside O
in O
the O
warm O
weather O
; O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter O

decent O
wine B
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

everytime O
i O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
ues O
, O
i O
get O
angry O
that O
i O
did O
n't O
just O
go O
to O
zucchero B
pomodori I
. O

this O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place B
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

the O
service B
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B
. O

you O
'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
do O
n't O
compare O
. O

i O
'm O
partial O
to O
the O
gnocchi B
. O

this O
place B
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

they O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

the O

bland O
oily O

. O

sauce B

much O
flavor O

if O

planet B
thailand I
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
i O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B
food I
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

with O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B
, O
i O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
i O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

it O
's O
all O
about O
the O
food B
! O
! O

i O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B
, O
there O
were O
n't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O
. O

those O
rolls B
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B
was O
n't O
fresh O
. O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

hurley O
's O
is O
like O
cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
actually O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

try O
the O
crunchy B
tuna I
, O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

i O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
i O
ca O
n't O
get O
enough O
. O

first O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B
terrace I
. O

the O
food B
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over-bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

the O
steak B
tartare I
is O
a O
great O
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B
kitchen I
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

great O
wine B
selection I
, O
gigondas B
is O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
and O
the O
house B
champagne I
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

it O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
french B
food I
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

have O
recommended O
the O
place B
to O
friends O
, O
always O
gets O
good O
response O
. O

pizza O
- O
the O
only O
pizza B
in O
nyc O
that O

toppings O
- O
the O

tastes O
like O
the O
best O
, O
freshly O
baked O
bread O
! O

veal O
parmigana O
- O
better O
than O
patsy O
's O

more O
reasonably O

too O
! O

i O
take O
all O
my O
nyc O

's I
. O

not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O

, O
but O
saul O

in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B
and O
has O
great O
food B
! O

i O
've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
. O

i O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
-- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B
and O
nice O
service B
. O

i O
'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
i O
all O
enjoy O
mizu B
very O
much O
... O
and O
we O
're O
repeat O
customers O
. O

even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
i O
was O
there O
. O

make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
spicy B
scallop I
roll.. I
. O

it O
's O
delicious O
! O

moules B
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B
ravioli I
was O
very O
salty O
! O

took O
my O
mom O
for O
mother O
's O
day O
, O
and O
the O
maitre B
d I
' I
was O
pretty O
rude O
. O

told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved O
. O

stepped O
on O
my O
foot O
on O
the O
second O
time O
he O
reached O
over O
me O
to O
adjust O
lighting O
. O

tiny O
dessert B
was O
$ O
8.00 O
... O
just O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
is O
. O

the O
drinks B
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B
selection I
is O
fairly O
priced O
. O

try O
their O
chef B
's I
specials I
-- O
they O
are O
to O
die O
for O
. O

service B
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O
