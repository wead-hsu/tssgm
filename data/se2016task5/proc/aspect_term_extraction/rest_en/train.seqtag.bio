when O
we O
stumbled O
on O
leon B
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
but O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

the O
waitress B
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
, O
we O
were O
told O
no O
... O

then O
, O
to O
top O
things O
off O
, O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend O
's O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes O
. O

such O
a O
disappointment O
... O

rude O
service B
, O
medicore O

of O

a O
grat O
time O
at O
jekyll B
and I
hyde I
! O

i O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it-especially O
the O
shows B
and O
actors B
. O

our O
server B
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

i O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

the O
food B
was O
good O
too O
. O

the O
tuna B
and O
wasabe B
potatoes I
are O
excellent O
. O

the O
outdoor B
atmosphere I
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

service B
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

this O
was O
a O
repeat O

great O
service B
, O
great O
food B

are O
in O
line O
. O

compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands-down O
. O

but O
too O
far O
east O
! O

i O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
patsy O
's O
frequently O
. O

the O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh B
mozzarella I
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizza O
ria O
's O
. O

two O
complaints- O
their O
appetizer B
selection I
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

so O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O
. O

wait B
staff I
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B
on O
the O
uws O
! O

by O
far O
the O
best O
salad B
i O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O

fine O

over O
100 O
different O

a O
must O
try O
! O

on O
a O
recent O
sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
i O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant B
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
doubt O
. O

this O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
, O
relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

the O
chicken B
pot I
pie I
is O
excpetiona O
, O
the O
cheeseburger B
huge O
and O
delictable O
, O
and O
the O
service B
professional O
wan O
warm O
. O

with O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

we O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid-town O
. O

i O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O
. O

the O
staff B
is O
no O
nonsense O
. O

the O
food B
options O
rule O
. O

when O
i O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
i O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

worth O
visiting O
the O
1st B
ave I
spot I
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

i O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk-up O
two O
fridays O
ago O
when O
i O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
l.a O
. O

being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

i O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
i O
like O
uni O
. O
( O

for O
those O
of O
you O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uni O
is O
sea O
urchin O
in O
japanese O
, O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
. O
) O

he O
served O
me O
an O
uni B
hand I
roll I
, O
which O
i O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
it O
was O
heaven O
! O

aside O
from O
the O
sea O
urchin O
, O
the O
chef O
recommended O
an O
assortment O
of O
fish O
including O
fatty O
yellow O
tail O
, O
boton O
shrimp O
, O
blue O
fin O
torro O
( O
fatty O
tuna O
) O
, O
sea O
eel O
, O
etc O
. O

the O
sake B
menu I
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

all O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

try O
the O
lobster B
teriyaki I
and O
the O
rose B
special I
roll I
. O

we O
visited O
orsay O
during O
ny O
restaurant O
week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

service B
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non-intrusive O
. O

food B
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
i O
wish O
the O
pork B
belly I
that O
i O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt-in-your-mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

wine B
list I
selection I
is O
good O
and O
wine-by-the-glass B
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

traditional B
french I
decour I
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

i O
've O
been O
to O
at O
cafe B
spice I
probably O
5-8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
indian O
restaurant O
around O
union O
square O
. O

to O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
service B
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
ok O
. O

seating B
is O
always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

food B
is O
usually O
very O
good O
, O
though O
ocasionally O
i O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B
vegatables I
in I
side I
orders I
. O

as O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

the O
decor B
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye-pleasing O
with O
several O
semi-private B
boths I
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

i O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
red B
eye I
. O

the O
first O
time O
i O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B
jazz I
band I
and O
atmosphere B
, O
i O
ordered O
the O
lobster O
cobb O
salad O
. O

i O
've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
. O

it O
's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B
in O
nyc O
. O

you O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
red B
eye I
grill I
. O

if O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B
. O

we O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years O
. O

the O
restaurant B
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O
. O

the O
food B
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
-- O
the O
food O
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance B
of I
herbs I
and I
tomatoes I
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

it O
's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
ny O
. O

we O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
jekyll B
and I
hyde I
pub I
last O
night O
. O

we O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks O
. O

after O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

the O
server B
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served O
us O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

the O
place O
's O
decor B
and O
hidden B
bathrooms I
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant B
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks O
! O

if O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

my O
husband O
and O
i O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
jekyll B
and I
hyde I
pub I
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

the O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
i O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B
tortelini I
. O

the O
entertainment O
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O
. O

please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B
. O

its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

you O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

our O
first O
time O
in O
new O
york O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
new O
york O
bagel O
. O

we O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O
. O

the O
bagel B
was O
huge O
. O

they O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O
. O

the O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B
with O
cream O
cheese O
( O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
) O
. O

i O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

this O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
cafe O
st. O
bart O
's O
and O
i O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B
and O
the O
service B
was O
. O

when O
i O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
think O
i O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
i O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

i O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend O
the O
lobster B
roll I
- O
not O
to O
much O
mayo O
; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh O
lobster B
. O

other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B
, O
santa B
fe I
chopped I
salad I
and O
fish B
and I
chips I
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
cafe O
st. O
bart O
's O
for O
their O
food B
, O
the O
ambience B
and O
wonderful O
service B
. O

all O
the O
staff B
is O
absolutely O
professional O
! O
! O

i O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes O
. O

but O
they O
do O
. O

( O
that O
is O
a O
must O
, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O
... O
) O

if O
you O
want O
to O
dine O
with O
large O
party O
, O
i O
recommend O
to O
make O
reservation O
basement O
. O

there O
's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
) O
. O

this O
restaurant B
was O
way O
overhyped O
. O

my O
chow B
fun I
and I
chow I
see I
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily O
. O

okay-i O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

the O
scallion B
pancakes I
and O
fried B
dumplings I
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

the O
service B
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant B
. O

it O
's O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi B
was O
pretty O
below O
average O
... O
the O
tuna B
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls B
had O
no O
flavor O
. O

i O
definitely O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
. O

there O
are O
many O
thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
toons O

is O
delicious O
and O
everything O

is O
reasonable O
although O
the O

is O
poor O

cute O
and O
quaint O
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

salads B
were O
fantastic O
. O

although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

ingredients B
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

we O
will O
be O
back O
. O

this O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
sushi B
. O

it O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside-out O
roll O
, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that O
's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O
. O

the O
spicy B
tuna I
roll I
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
i O
've O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O
. O

the O
yellowtail B
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well O
. O

i O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all B
you I
can I
eat I
deal I
, O
however O
-- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food O
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O
. O

in O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place B
i O
'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
i O
'm O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town O
. O

big B
wong I
gets O
big O
ups O
for O
a O
fine O
establishment O
. O

they O
have O
it O
all O
-- O
great O
price O
, O
food B
, O
and O
service B
. O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

the O
food O
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

and O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee B
, O
noodles B
, O
and O
rice B
dishes I
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3-6 O
each O
) O
. O

the O
takeout B
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

this O
place B
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular O
. O

went O
here O
on O
a O
friend O
's O
reccomendation O
. O

enjoyed O
a O
very O
nice O
caesar B
salad I
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula B
and I
goat I
cheese I
... O
.both O
very O
tasty O
. O

we O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B
dish I
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

we O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B
chocolate B
cake I
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

we O
'd O
go O
back O
again O

i O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B
with O
some O
co-workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

the O
staff B
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B
is O
lovely O
. O

we O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
manager B
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O
. O

yes O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
, O
but O
i O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

we O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food B
and O
ok O
service B
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food B
and O
bad O
service B
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
good B
and O
bad O
service B
. O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O
! O

the O
place O
is O
a O
bistro O
which O
means O
: O
simple O
dishes B
and O
wine B
served O
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O
atmosphere B
. O

and O
where O
does O
patis B
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

you O
are O
not O
eating O
haut O
cuisine O
with O
subtle O
hints O
of O
whatever O
but O
: O
cassuolet O
, O
steake O
fritte O
, O
tripe O
stew O
, O
etc O
; O
simple O
stuff O
. O

and O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
pastis B
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

right O
off O
the O
l O
in O
brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B
with O
good O
pizza B
. O

mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat O
cheese O
and O
panchetta O
( O
raddichio B
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O
) O
. O

my O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B
pizza I
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

the O
sangria B
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B
but O
i O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

overall O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

coming O
from O
boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
emma O
's O
pizza O
in O
kendall O
square O
in O
cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
! O
) O

i O
started O
out O
with O
a O
bombay B
beer I
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

for O
dinner O
i O
had O
the O
chicken O
tikka-masala O
and O
some O
garlic O
naan O
. O

mmmmm O
... O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

service B
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B
were O
friendly O
. O

it O
's O
a O
nice O
place B
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

we O
have O
lived O
in O
chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

the O
food B
is O
authentic O
italian O
- O
delicious O
! O

pizza B
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
homemade B
pasta I
. O

ambience B
is O
delightful O
, O
service B
impeccable O
. O

i O
'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B
. O

the O
hanger B
steak I
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

service B
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

do O
not O
try O
unless O
you O
're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste O
. O

i O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place B
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

this O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B
and O
service B
was O
excellent O
. O

the O
filet B
mignon I
dish I
was O
superb O
! O

i O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

it O
's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B
. O

i O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place B
! O
! O
! O

from O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

i O
like O
the O
ambience B
, O
it O
's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

i O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend O
's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

the O
sushi B
is O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O

and O
amazingly O
cheap O
. O

big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B
! O

we O
ordered O
some O
beef B
and I
noodle I
soup I
dishes I
from O
the O
thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
thai O
. O

we O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

we O
wo O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B
. O

however O
, O
i O
think O
this O
place B
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot O
. O

next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks O
. O

my O
girlfriend O
and O
i O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

the O
pizza B
and O
wine B
were O
excellent-the O
service B
too O
-- O
but O
what O
really O
made O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B
dining I
area I
. O

it O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
i O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
ny O
-- O
i O
am O
from O
italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

they O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
i O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

check O
this O
place B
out O
! O

highly O
recommended O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

first O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B
is O
*not* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
citysearch O
's O
editorial O
review O
. O

either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor O
's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

the O
tables B
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B
is O
typical O
of O
any O
italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B
list I
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

slightly O
above O
average O
wines B
start O
at O
$ O
70+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30+ O
. O

service B
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

for O
instance O
, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
, O
i O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
, O
etc O
... O
. O

somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not O
constitute O
proper O
service B
. O

to O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
teodora B
. O

to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O
. O

not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B
was O
edible O
- O
bland O
and O
/ O
or O
made O
with O
weird O
rosemary B
or I
orange I
flavoring I
. O

fish B
was O
overdone O
. O

cute O
place B
, O
nice O
wait B
staff I
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O
. O

someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

one O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B
- O
that O
's O
it O
. O

skip O
this O
restaurant B
, O
it O
's O
a O
big O
disappointment O
. O

myagi B
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
; O
the O
place O
the O
negative O
reviews O
describe O
sound O
like O
they O
were O
somewhere O
else O
. O

i O
've O
never O
had O
bad O
service B
and O
the O
fish B
is O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

their O
tuna B
tartar I
appetizer I
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

i O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
i O
'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B
in O
fornino O
's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

it O
is O
simply O
amazing O
. O

the O
place B
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O

give O
this O
place B
a O
try O

you O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O

family O

in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B

we O

or O
amex O
only O
! O

with O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B
salad I
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

the O
menu B
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

we O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B
branzino I
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O
. O

the O
decor B
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner-ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
east O
village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
prune B
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

no O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

this O
place B
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant B
. O

this O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

i O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
disney O
. O

our O
food B
was O
great O
too O
! O

and O
really O
large O
portions B
. O

the O
staff B
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
new O
york O
. O

we O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
. O

if O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
jekyll B
and I
hyde I
. O

it O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
disney O
type O
special O
effects O
. O

the O
food B
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

i O
am O
going O
to O
the O
mid O
town O
location O
next O
. O

the O
place B
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
. O

my O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

the O
characters B
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

the O
food B
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

it O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

however O
, O
i O
think O
jeckll B
and I
hydes I
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

we O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation O
sigh O
on O
them O
. O

service B
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

drinks B
way O
over O
priced O
. O

food B
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
another O
visit O

great O
pizza B

the O
pizza B

was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

whenever O

a O
little O

growing O
up O
in O
ny O
, O
i O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels O
. O

ess-a- O
bagel O
( O
either O
by O
sty-town O
or O
midtown O
) O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B
in O
ny O
. O

the O
bagels B
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O
. O

they O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B
cheeses I
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B
are O
great O
. O

the O
lox B
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

highly O
recommended O
to O
all O
! O

i O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
either O
. O

not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B
. O

prices O
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant B
. O

zero O
ambiance B
to O
boot O
. O

i O
thought O
this O
place B
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
... O
.but O
definitely O
nothing O
great O
. O

the O
ambience B
was O
nice O
, O
but O
service B
was O
n't O
so O
great O
. O

when O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
... O
especially O
considering O
the O
prices O
. O

this O
is O
the O
best O
shabu-shabu B
restaurant I
in O
the O
try-state O
area O
. O

i O
have O
lived O
in O
japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food B
and O
the O
feel B
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
japan O
. O

thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
shabu-shabu B
. O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
sushi O
establishment O
in O
tokyo O
. O

the O
owner B
and O
staff B
are O
all O
japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B
. O

despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O

as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
he O
made O
the O
reservation O
for O
us O
and O
said O
we O
would O
not O
be O
disappointed O
! O

we O
were O
n't O
! O

the O
prices O
were O
cheap O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service B
and O
food B
. O

we O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
new O
york O
. O

went O
there O
for O
an O
office O
lunch O
. O

the O
location B
and O
ambience B
is O
ok O
but O
the O
food B
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

try O
green B
curry I
with I
vegetables I
. O

the O
quantity O
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O

the O
service B
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O

get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

i O
was O
there O
on O

very O
good O

moderate O

i O
found O
the O
food B
, O
service B
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
i O
have O
been O
there O
. O

the O
food B
was O
authentic O
. O

i O
felt O
as O
though O
i O
were O
eating O
in O
paris O
. O

the O
service B
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

the O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

very O
good O
wine B
choices I
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese O

? O

who O
has O
room O
for O
cheesesticks O
with O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
nyc O
! O

get O
the O
pepperoni B
- O
yum O
- O
and O
a O
family B

salad I
. O

great O
staff B
. O

always O
great O
service B
! O

i O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

fantastic O
! O

the O
food B
is O
good O
, O
i O
ca O
n't O
lie O
. O

but O
the O
staff B
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O
. O

the O
hostess B
and O
the O
waitress B
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

we O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

this O
place B
is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O
! O

i O
'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

amma B
is O
nothing O
special O
. O

the O
two O
star O
chefs O
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O
. O

i O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

do O
n't O
dine O
at O
tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B
dishes I
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non-veg B
selections I
. O

decor B
is O
nice O
though O
service B
can O
be O
spotty O
. O

this O
place B
is O
always O
packed O
. O

i O
know O
because O
i O
live O
nearby O
. O

most O
importantly O
, O
food B
is O
excellent O
. O

try O
the O
sea B
bass I
. O

highly O
recommended O
. O

first O
of O
all O
dal B
bukhara I
rocks O
. O

as O
a O
student O
in O
nyu O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by O
. O

but O
ive O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
for O
the O
past O
2 O
yrs O
and O
finally O
decided O
to O
eat O
here O
. O

i O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B
was O
awsome O
. O

just O
awsome O
. O

and O
yes O
dal B
bukhara I
is O
so O
dam O
good O
and O
so O
are O
all O
the O
kababs B
. O

they O
are O
opening O
two O
more O
places O
as O
i O
saw O
a O
flyer O
there O
one O
in O
yonkers O
which O
is O
a O
restraunt O
and O
banquet O
hall O
and O
another O
one O
in O
parsipanny O
new O
jersey O
. O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

10 O

i O
have O
n't O
been O
to O
the O
other O
locations O
. O

haru B
on I
park I
s I
is O
simply O
disgusting O
. O

the O
fish B
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O
. O

quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B
i O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

believe O
us O
, O
we O
've O
been O
eating O
sushi O
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O
. O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly O
. O

the O
all-u-can-eat B
sushi I
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor O
quality O
. O

limited O
menu B
, O
no-so-fresh O
ingredients B
, O
thinly-sliced O
fish B
, O
fall-apart O
rice B
. O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B
sauce I
( O
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
) O
, O
the O
vinegar-soaked O
rice B
, O
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish O
. O

the O
waitstaffs B
are O
nice O
though O
. O

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O
! O

i O
have O
been O
to O
roth B
's I
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O
. O

once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch O
. O

both O
times O
i O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

they O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O
. O

much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

the O
dinner B
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
i O
would O
have O
again O
. O

i O
had O
their O
eggs B
benedict I
for O
brunch O
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
i O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

this O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
. O

with O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B
. O

the O
service B
was O
attentive O
. O

i O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O
here O
again O

planet B
thai I
is O
great O
! O

we O
love O
the O
food B
, O
drinks B
, O
and O
atmosphere B
! O

the O
svc B
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B
is O
a O
must O
! O

try O
the O
pad B
thai I
, O
it O
's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

just O
because O
it O
's O
cheap O
does O
not O
mean O
the O
portions B
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B
is O
nasty O
, O
it O
is O
great O
! O

just O
remember O
, O
the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

it O
's O
popular O
w/the O
late O
crowd O
. O

they O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
, O
did O
n't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter O
. O

also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

an O

chennai B
garden I
is O
my O
favorite O
indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

they O
have O
authentic O
indian B
at O
amazin O
prices O
. O

this O
restaurant O
is O
vegetarian O
; O
there O
are O
no O
meat O
dishes B
whatsoever O
. O

the O
seats B
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

it O
's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant B
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B
bar I
and O
has O
great O
staff B
. O

the O
food B
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B
sizes I
are O
appropriate O
. O

this O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant B
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner O
meeting O
with O
business O
associates O
. O

not O
a O
great O
place B
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O
. O

lloovve O
this O
place B
. O

food B
is O
excellent O
. O

fish B
is O
so O
very O
fresh O
. O

waitstaff B
are O
very O
friendly O
. O

love O
yuka B
. O

mermaid B
inn I
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B
. O

the O
menu B
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B
are O
excellent O
. O

the O
lobster B
sandwich I
is O
good O
and O
the O
spaghetti B
with I
scallops I
and I
shrimp I
is O
great O
. O

the O
service B
is O
good O
and O
ambience B
is O
good O
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing O
. O

the O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant B
is O
the O
prices O
. O

even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

the O
lobster B
sandwich I
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

went O
to O
village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

we O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
were O
n't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

we O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

the O
food B
was O
delicious O
( O
i O
had O
a O
halibut B
special I
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B
was O
top-notch O
. O

when O
my O
dessert O
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

we O
ate O
at O
this O
thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B
. O

we O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
msg O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B
. O

why O
? O

they O
do O
n't O
concern O
much O
of O
customer O
's O
health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

please O
do O
n't O
fool O
us O
. O

i O
visit O
new O
green O
bo O
when O
i O
have O
money O
or O
when O
i O
am O
broke O
. O

i O
recommend O
the O
jelly B
fish I
, O
drunken B
chicken I
and O
the O
soupy B
dumplings I
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B
fry I
blue I
crab I
. O

the O
food B
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B
are O
nice O
. O

of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

authentic O
shanghai O
style O
and O
i O
can O
not O
recommend O
a O
better O
shanghai O
place O
in O
new O
york O
. O

have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B
remains O
excellent O
. O

cheese B
plate I
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
$ O
10 O
. O

the O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B
, O
paninis B
, O
tramezzinis B
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

( O
the O
asparagus B
, I
truffle I
oil I
, I
parmesan I
bruschetta I
is O
a O
winner O
! O
) O

wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
without O
being O
over-priced O
. O

be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
, O
and O
always O
delicious O
, O
specials B
. O

definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O
. O

i O
loved O
this O
place B
! O
! O

i O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
so O
great O
and O
i O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O
. O

the O
food B
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

the O
wait B
staff I
is O
very O
freindly O
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O
. O

i O
like O
cafe B
noir I
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
! O
! O

the O
service B
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

the O
waitress B
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitress O
ing O
. O

after O
dinner O
the O
manager B
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
america O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

we O
did O
tip O
, O
i O
guess O
the O
model O
/ O
waitress B
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

the O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
i O
wish O
cafe B
noir I
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
. O

pizza B
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

salads B
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O
. O

you O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B
. O

it O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

decor B
is O
charming O
. O

service B
is O
average O
. O

what O
a O
great O
place B
. O

i O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

the O
ambience B
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

i O
was O
n't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
i O
guess O
that O
's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
sea O
if O
you O
like O
thai B
cuisine I
! O

i O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B
service I
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

a O
gentleman B
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

when O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
mcdonald O
's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

while O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

the O
service O
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
i O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
mcdonald O
's O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

never O
again O
! O

i O
absolutely O
loved O
this O
place B
. O

my O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
i O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

excellent O
atmosphere B
, O
delicious O
dishes B
good O
and O
friendly O
service B
. O

this O
is O
can O
became O
on O
e O
of O
the O
ny O
italian O
food O
fare O
institutions O
. O

i O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

the O
wine B
list I
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

a O
friend O
from O
seattle O
and O
i O
went O
on O
a O
thursday O
night O
around O
8:30 O
. O

everything O
was O
wonderful O
; O
food B
, O
drinks B
, O
staff B
, O
mileau B
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place B
! O

i O
have O
been O
to O
casimir B
over O
5 O
times O
and O
i O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

the O
food B
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

i O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations O
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B
did O
n't O
have O
my O
name O
. O

if O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B
table I
. O

the O
staff B
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex B
bathroom I
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

my O
boyfriend O
and O
i O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

from O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B
, O
i O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff B
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
caviar O
russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B
and O
fantastic O
service B
. O

nice O
family O
owned O
traditional O
restaurant B
. O

fresh O
ingredients B
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O
. O

i O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
hoboken O
. O

friendly O
staff B
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you O
're O
with O
. O

my O
friends O
and O
i O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
ny O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
chance O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

i O
found O
the O
food B
to O
be O
outstanding O
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B
dish I
i O
had O
. O

i O
also O
ordered O
the O
change B
mojito I
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

my O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B
sum I
, O
which O
was O
good O
... O
not O
outstanding O
, O
but O
good O
. O

we O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B
patio I
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

overall O
, O
excellent O
restaurant B
! O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

the O
food B
was O
good O
. O

the O
place B
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

but O
the O
service B
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

i O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

the O
buffet B
had O
a O
nice O
selection O
. O

the O
food B
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B
. O

service B
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

i O
would O
go O
back O
. O

i O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
roxy O
's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B
. O

my O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

but O
, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun O
. O

consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

i O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B
sandwich I
on I
a I
roll I
. O

it O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
pastrami-but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
taste-i O
've O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

this O
place B
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B
. O

the O
last O
two O
times O
i O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
i O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

and O
the O
tom B
kha I
soup I
was O
pathetic O
. O

if O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
thai B
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

we O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
saturday O
, O
and O
i O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B
. O

the O
pesto B
pizza I
was O
excellent O
, O
thin-crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B
italian I
cheese I
that O
i O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

conveniently O
located O
too O
, O
being O
right O
on O
bedford O
ave O
. O

the O
back B
garden I
sitting I
area I
is O
very O
pleasant O
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal O
herb O
garden O
. O

i O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

we O
had O
the O
lobster B
sandwich I
and O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

my O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B
fries I
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

we O
had O
the O
scallops B
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B
was O
wonderful O
. O

i O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation O
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis B
that O
were O
just O
right O
. O

we O
will O
be O
back O
. O

love O
the O
food B
. O

it O
's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B
comfort I
food I
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
prices O
. O

highly O
recommended O
. O

i O
've O
lived O
in O

for O
5 O
years O

it O
all O
. O

great O

and O
an O
unpretensious O

very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B
sausages I
, O
sardines B
with I
biscuits I
, O
large B
whole I
shrimp I
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B
ice I
cream I
( O
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
i O
've O
ever O
had O
) O
. O

i O
'm O
glad O
i O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
ny O
. O

we O
have O
tried O
every O
thai O
restaurant O
between O
atlantic O
avenue O
and O
4th O
streets O
, O
and O
joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

the O
freshest O
, O
best O
variety O
, O
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B
. O

also O
very O
inexpensive O
. O

a O
great O
choice O
at O
any O
cost O
and O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

the O
service B
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O
. O

we O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche B
mix I
( I
special I
) I
, O
crab B
dumplings I
, O
assorted B
sashimi I
, O
sushi B
and O
rolls B
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake B
, O
and O
the O
banana B
tempura I
. O

overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

definitely O
a O
great O
spot B
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

average O
to O
good O
thai B
food I
, O
but O
terrible O
delivery B
. O

i O
've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O
. O

they O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
i O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O
. O

a O
thai B
restaurant I
out O
of O
rice O
during O
dinner O
? O

the O
food B
arrived O
20 O
minutes O
after O
i O
called O
, O
cold O
and O
soggy O
. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

this O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place B
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

an O
excellent O
service B

went O
to O
cafe O
spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

we O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O
. O

she O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
indian O
food O
. O

we O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

the O
food B
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates O
. O

we O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
gulab B
jamun I
( I
dessert I
) I
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter O
. O

i O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

i O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
could O
n't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

service B
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B
was O
fantastic O
. O

guacamole+shrimp B
appetizer I
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B
, O
very O
good O
, O
did O
n't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

maybe O
tomorrow O
; O
- O
) O

you O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B
. O

the O
food B
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

always O
a O
nice O
crowd B
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

go O
here O
. O

good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

i O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
i O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B
place I
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

however O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

by O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
manhattan O
. O

the O
crust B
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B
is O
friendly O
. O

for O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
come O
to O
alphabet O
city O
, O
i O
say O
, O
good O
- O
stay O
out O
. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O
! O

we O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O

the O
menu B
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

we O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O
. O

the O
fish B
was O
really O
, O
really O
fresh O
. O

i O
lived O
in O
maine O
for O
ten O
years O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
fish O
. O

we O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
new O
york O
. O

i O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria B
as O
i O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

all O
of O
the O
pizzas B
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better O
! O

i O
highly O
recommend O
the O
sophia B
pizza I
. O

it O
's O
to O
die O
for O
! O

the O
food B
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

there O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O
! O

we O
were O
n't O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O
. O

as O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

so O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

for O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B
plus O
great O
service B
, O
roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
avoid O
! O

i O
've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O
. O

the O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

i O
'm O
sure O
i O
'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

the O
blond B
wood I
decor I
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium B
sake I
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B
is O
great O
. O

mizu B
is O
the O
japenese O
find O
in O
grammercy O
. O

while O
their O
kitchen B
food I
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
sushi B
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B
the O
best O
around O
, O
the O
service B
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

warning O
: O
you O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
mizu B
! O

thalia B
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B
serving O
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B
does O
n't O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

i O
ordered O
the O
smoked B
salmon I
and I
roe I
appetizer I
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

the O
entree B
was O
bland O
and O
small O
, O
dessert B
was O
not O
inspired O
. O

i O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive O
menu B
. O

the O
view B
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B
is O
great O
. O

wonderful O
strawberry B
daiquiries I
as O
well O
! O

definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
battery O
park O
city O
! O

one O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
manhattan O
. O

authentic O
taiwanese B
food I
that O
's O
cheap O
... O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

( O
besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O
) O
. O

the O
cold B
appetizer I
dishes I
taste O
like O
the O
way O
i O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
i O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
taiwan O
. O

delicious O
simple O
food B
in O
nice O
outdoor B
atmosphere I
. O

kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B
staff I
. O

i O
really O
like O
both O
the O
scallops B
and O
the O
mahi B
mahi I
( I
on I
saffron I
risotto I
-yum O
! O
) O
. O

my O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B
and I
mashed I
potatos I
. O

delicious O
crab B
cakes I
too O
. O

even O
if O
the O
food B
was O
n't O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

great O
neighborhood O
joint B
. O

this O
is O
a O
nice O
pizza B
place I
with O
good O
selection B
of I
thin I
crust I
pizza I
including O
the O
basil B
slice I
. O

their O
calzones B
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit-inducing O
, O
yuck O
. O

they O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

the O
counter B
service I
is O
bad O
. O

they O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

they O
're O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O
. O

no O
pizza B
33 I
for O
me O
! O

anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
, O
where O
greasy O
, O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O
. O

the O
dosas B
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
i O
'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
i O
'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

the O
sandwiches B
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

calling O
the O
place B
hampton O
chutney O
co. O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room B
with O
unhelpful O
clerks B
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O
. O

seriously O
, O
this O
place B
kicks O
ass O
. O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
unheralded O
, O
the O
service B
impecible O
, O
and O
the O
food B
magnificant O
. O

best O
italian B
food I
i O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
) O
. O

it O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
do O
not O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

this O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
, O
peaceful O
place B
to O
eat O
outside O
. O

the O
restaurant B
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
hudson O
river O
and O
the O
statue O
of O
liberty O
. O

it O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O
. O

the O
food B
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B
dishes I
, O
and O
the O
drinks B
are O
delicious O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
place B
to O
take O
out-of-towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

great O

the O

be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
i O
am O
hungry O
and O
i O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
... O
their O
pizza B
. O

i O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

it O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

this O
tiny O
williamsburg B
spot I
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

the O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
nyc O
. O

even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
new O
york O
pizza O
restaurants O
) O
. O

i O
've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

compared O
to O
ess-a O
, O
tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

they O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

the O
cream B
cheeses I
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
i O
love O
that O
coffee B
! O
! O

a O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O
! O

a O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
sunday O
morning O
! O

bagels B
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

i O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B
! O
.. O

the O
turkey B
burgers I
are O
scary O
! O

the O
worst O
excuse O
for O
japanese B
food I
i O
've O
ever O
encountered O
. O

the O
soup B
for I
the I
udon I
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

the O
sushi B
was O
awful O
! O

the O
rice B
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

furthermore O
, O
the O
rice B
had O
no O
seasoning O
, O
so O
the O
sushi B
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting O
. O

the O
fish B
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

it O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
japanese B
cuisine I
. O

good O
, O
fast O
service B
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

food B
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive O
. O

the O
location B
is O
perfect O
. O

give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

i O
thought O
going O
to O
jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
domincan O
exprience O
. O

jimmy O
is O
dominican O
! O

well O
, O
this O
place B
is O
so O
ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O
. O

if O
you O
like O
your O
music B
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B
minimun I
then O
you O
'll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

would O
never O
go O
back O
there O
. O

too O
bad O
latin O
quarters O
closed O
. O

that O
place O
was O
awesome O
, O
, O
, O
sally O

the O
flavors O
robust O

there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O

the O
place B

quiet O
and O
delightful O
. O

service B
was O
good O
and O
food B
is O
wonderful O
. O

i O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
i O
tried O
their O
salmon B
and O
crab B
salad I
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

it O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

as O
a O
retired O
hipster O
, O
i O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
lucky B
strike I
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid-back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O
. O

the O
wait B
staff I
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O

not O

the O

especially O
their O
cooked-to-perfection O
mussels B
in I
spicy I
tomato I
sauce I
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B
. O

but O
the O
best O
part O
about O
ls O
is O
the O
late B
night I
atmosphere I
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
bts O
. O

you O
can O
get O
a O
completely O

the O

outrageously O
good O
taste O

moreover O
, O
takes O

. O

you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B
. O

suan B
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
i O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

its O
location B
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
hutner O
college O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
suan B
again O
and O
again O
. O

i O
love O
their O
thai B

noodles B
with I
shrimp I
and I
chicken I
and I
coconut I
juice I
is O
the O
must O
! O

i O
was O
in O
love O
with O
pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O
. O

i O
will O
go O
back O
to O
suan B
soon O
! O

in O
summer-eat O
outside O
on O
a O
terrace B
( O
another O
great O

i O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

i O
can O
not O
imagine O
better O
indian B
food I
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

i O
can O
not O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

this O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
thursday O
night O
dinner O
location O
. O

during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
chef B
and O
staff B
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O
. O

i O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

the O
food B
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B
you O
'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

the O
setting B
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

the O
food B
is O
excellent O
! O

if O
you O
're O
daring O
, O
try O
the O
balsamic B
vinegar I
over I
icecream I
, O
it O
's O
wonderful O
! O

do O
not O
get O
the O
go B
go I
hamburgers I
, O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
reviews O
say O
. O

they O
were O
such O
a O
rip-off O
( O
$ O
8.95 O
for O
four O
small O
meat O
patties O
in O
steamed O
buns O
) O
and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

the O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B
sum I
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table O
. O

the O
wait B
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

a O
few O
tips O
: O
skip O
the O
turnip B
cake I
, O
roast B
pork I
buns I
and O
egg B
custards I
. O

these O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

( O
1 O
) O
turnip O
cakes O
at O
the O
little O
kiosk O
on O
east O
side O
of O
mott O
st. O
just O
south O
of O
bayard O

( O
2 O
) O
egg O
custards O
and O
pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
canal O
. O

after O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
i O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

i O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

the O
food B
was O
exceptional O
. O

the O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
balthazar O
etc O
. O

i O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special O
, O
the O
braised B
lamb I
shank I
in I
red I
wine I
, O
which O
was O
excellent O
. O

the O
service B
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
casual O
. O

the O
restaurant B
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B

this O
little O
place B
has O
a O
cute O
interior B
decor I
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

the O
pad B
se I
ew I
chicken I
was O
delicious O
, O
however O
the O
pad B
thai I
was O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil O
next O
time O
. O

have O
eaten O
at O
ginger B
house I
several O
times O
, O
and O
it O
's O
always O
good O
. O

the O
fried B
dumplings I
are O
great O
! O

finally O
a O
reliable O
chinese B
restaurant I
! O

this O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer B
service I
. O

the O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

they O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O
. O

terrible O
, O
terrible O
management B
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut-down O
. O

never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

delicious O
bagels B
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O
. O

spreads B
and O
toppings B
are O
great O
- O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey O
. O

service B
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

only O
drawback O
- O
they O
wo O
n't O
toast O
your O
bagel O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O
bagel O
. O

but O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
new O
york O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

the O
food B
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B
, O
well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

if O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you O
'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

rao B
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
's O
nothing O
special O
. O

i O
've O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
indian O
restaurants O
. O

but O
after O
last O
night O
, O
spice O
grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
i O
'm O
eating O
indian B
cuisine I
. O

you O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B
appetizers I
. O

even O
my O
indian O
friend O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

this O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

great O
food B
, O
great O
prices O
, O
great O
service B
. O

if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality O
, O
cheap O
eats B
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

it O
's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian B
food I
. O

i O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that O
's O
the O
cheff B
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

also O
it O
's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic O
and O
confortable O
place B
, O
the O
service B
it O
's O
just O
perfect O
... O
they O
're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place O
! O

i O
love O
ess-a-bagel O
, O
but O
i O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
so O
i O
often O
go O
to O
murray O
's O
for O
convenience O
. O

their O
bagels B
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel O
place O
. O

great O
bagels B
made O
the O
old-fashioned O
way O
. O

the O
appetizing O
is O
excellent O
- O
just O
as O
good O
as O
zabars O
barney O
greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
( O
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
) O
. O

drawbacks O
: O
service B
is O
slow O
and O
they O
do O
n't O

the O
food B
was O
absolutely O
amazing O

were O
the O
best O
we O
've O
ever O

! O

the O
lamb B
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B
was O
divine O
! O
! O

the O
waiter B
was O
attentive O

the O

not O

with O

the O
calamari B

any O

were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O
! O

loved O
it O
! O

out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
italian O
restaurants O
in O
queens O
, O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

the O
shrimp B
scampi I
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B
were O
plentiful O
. O

it O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

if O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
manhattan O
and O
ca O
n't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
corona B
. O

the O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service B
. O

the O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B
do O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O
. O

cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables O
at O
most O
. O

service B
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O
. O

food B
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
what O
i O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining O
experience O
. O

my O
friend O
from O
milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

too O
bad O
the O
food B
was O
n't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

the O
porcini B
mushroom I
pasta I
special I
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B
tagliatelle I
. O

a O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

but O
that O
was O
n't O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
: O
a O
tiramisu B
that O
resembled O
nothing O
i O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

they O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips-good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

priced O
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O
. O

i O
really O
liked O
this O
place B
. O

everything O
i O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
i O
'm O
a O
eater O
. O

it O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

this O
place O
has O
the O
best O
chinese O
style O
bbq B
ribs I
in O
the O
city O
. O

i O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B
dishes I
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B
( I
rice I
porridge I
) I
. O

it O
's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

it O
's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

however O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
decor B
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
this O
place O
. O

quick O
and O
friendly O
service B
. O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

it O
's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O
. O

when O
i O
'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
i O
head O
for O
cafe O
st. O
bart O
's O
. O

when O
you O
're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B
dining I
room I
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand-painted O
high O
ceiling B
) O
you O
'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

the O
food B
is O
wonderful O
, O
tasty O
and O
filling O
, O
and O
the O
service B
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B
. O

ahhh O
... O

i O
recently O
tried O
suan B
and O
i O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

this O
little O
place B
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B
for O
your O
money O
. O

the O
service B
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot B
sauce I
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals O
. O

i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
i O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
i O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

they O
all O
know O
you O
. O

good O
food B
. O

good O
drink B
. O

how O
do O
you O
rate O
home O
? O

i O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B
like O
this O
. O

i O
thought O
i O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

great O
spot B
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks O
or O
quiet O
dinner O
. O

warm O
and O
friendly O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
terrific O
outdoor B
seating I
in O
the O
warmer O
months O
. O

the O
food B
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion B
of I
wines I
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O
. O

after O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

we O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O
. O

while O
the O
ambiance B
and O
atmosphere B
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B
and O
service B
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

we O
ordered O
the O
chicken B
casserole I
, O
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken O
, O
all O
dark O
meat O
and O
on O
the O
bone O
. O

probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
... O

i O
've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B
was O
fine O
, O
if O
not O
good O
. O

stick O
with O
the O
chicken B
, O
beef B
, O
and O
lamb B
dishes I
. O

i O
do O
n't O
usually O
order O
wine O
with O
indian O
so O
i O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine O
list O
or O
their O
wines O
. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer O
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O
. O

service B
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations O
on O
weekends O
though O
. O

skip O
dessert B
. O

best O
reuben B
sandwich I
ever O

as O
a O
fan O
of O
thai O
, O
i O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
nyc O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

the O
food B
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O
. O

it O
just O
was O
n't O
thai O
. O

went O
to O
ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza O
( O
as O
i O
love O
la O
pizza O
fresca O
) O
. O

was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O
. O

pizza B
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

ravioli B
was O
good O
... O
but O
i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

not O
enough O
wines B
by I
the I
glass I
either O
. O

service B
, O
however O
, O
was O
excellent O
... O
and O
i O
liked O
the O
setting B
/ I
atmosphere I
a O
lot O
. O

food B
was O
just O
average O
... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O
. O

this O
place B
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

authentic O
pakistani B
food I
. O

people B
are O
always O
friendly O
. O

do O
n't O
waste O
money O
on O
decor B
. O

just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B
. O

faan B
is O
sooo O
good O
. O

the O
best O

are O
cheap O
and O
good O
. O

what O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

the O
food B
was O
actually O
aweful O
. O

i O
'm O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

the O
mussles B
were O
the O
fishiest O
things O
i O
've O
ever O
tasted O
, O
the O
seabass B
was O
bland O
, O
the O
goat B
cheese I
salad I
was O
missing O
the O
goat O
cheese O
, O
the O
penne B
w I
/ I
chicken I
had O
bones O
in O
it O
... O
it O
was O
disgusting O
. O

nice O
atmosphere B
, O
the O
service B
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
desert B
was O
good O
. O

n't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner O
! O

this O
is O
the O
perfect O
date O
spot O
for O
williamsburg O
couples O
. O

the O
jukebox B
plays O
everything O
from O

the O
food B

amazing O
, O
rich O

the O

good O
service B
, O
but O
the O
food B
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O
. O

the O
portions B
are O
huge O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
( O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O
person O
) O
for O

among O
all O
of O
the O
new O

cute O
. O

the O

are O
huge O
, O
and O
the O
sushi B
is O
good O
. O

while O
it O

it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

staff B
is O
very O
accomodating O
. O

excellent O

was O
great O
. O

but O
$ O
1 O
for O
each O
small O

? O
? O
? O

worth O
it O
. O

i O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill O
. O

i O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

the O
decor B
is O
very O
simple O
but O

. O

the O

delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

the O
portions B
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

you O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B

of O
this O
world O
and O

it O
actually O
means O

way O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O
. O

consistently O
good O
japanese B
tapas I
. O

same O
owner O
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
typhoon O
, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
st. O
marks O
and O

always O
good O
drinks B
and O
service B
is O
pretty O
good O
; O

atmosphere B
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed O
too O
... O

a O
great O
place B
to O
meet O
up O
for O
some O
food O
and O
drinks O
... O

yakitori B
( I
bbq I
meats I
) I
is O
tasty O
too O
. O

it O
's O
also O
attached O
to O
angel O
's O
share O
, O
which O
is O
a O
cool O
, O
more O
romantic O
bar O
... O

just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we O
've O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
west O
village O
sushi O
restaurants O
. O

if O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
pre-sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B
, O
unfriendly O
staff B
and O
a O
sushi B
chef I
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

was O
n't O
going O
to O
share O
but O
i O
feel O
obligated O
... O
while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O
floor O
proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O
was O
preparing O
. O

no O
thanks O
! O
! O
! O

this O
place B
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

fabulous O
decor B
- O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
in O
a O
trendy O
manhattan O
restaurant O
, O
very O
very O
good O
food B
, O
cheaply-priced O
, O
generally O
friendly O
staff B
, O
and O
if O
you O
're O
a O
manhattanite O
, O
or O
spend O
most O
of O
your O
time O
in O
manhattan O
, O
rice B
avenue I
will O
make O
you O
feel O
at O
home O
... O
..very O
soho O
/ O
village O
/ O
upper O
west O
side O
minus O
the O
expensive O
prices O
and O
pretentious O
clientele O
... O
..all O
on O
roosevelt O
avenue O
! O

we O
were O
seated O
outside O
and O
the O
waiter B
spilled O
red O
wine O
and O
hot O
tea O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O
. O

we O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

one O
would O
think O
we O
'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

we O
left O
, O
never O
to O
return O
. O

with O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
uws O
, O
i O
do O
n't O
need O
overpriced O
food B
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait-staff B
who O
do O
n't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy O
service B
, O
and O
management B
that O
does O
n't O
care O
. O

i O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B
and O
i O
thought O
the O
food B
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
the O
bagel O
shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
ave O
. O

great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

you O
fellas O
above O
says O
its O
the O
best O
taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

however O
it O
is O
the O
only O
taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

the O
food B
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

you O
ca O
n't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
chinatown O
. O

they O
're O
are O
better O
taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
flushing O
, O
queens O
. O

baluchi B
's I
has O
solid O
food B
and O
a O
nice O
decor B
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

he O
offers O
subpar O
service B
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
soho O
. O

there O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B
! O

i O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B
. O

stuffing O
yourself O
with O
japanese O
food O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

you O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

$ O
20 O
for O
all B
you I
can I
eat I
sushi I
can O
not O
be O
beaten O
. O

i O
went O
to O
areo B
on O
a O
sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
, O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there O
. O

the O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

most O
of O
the O
servers B
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

the O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20's/30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

the O
vibe B
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
, O
service B
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O
! O

me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

food B
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B
of I
the I
new I
york I
city I
skiline I
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
i O
went O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window O
. O

although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water O
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B
to O
eat O
. O

i O
've O
eaten O
at O

gruppo O
a O
few O
times O

but O

often O
i O

the O
food B
is O
great O
. O

personal B
pans I
are O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
those O
hungry O
nights O
. O

i O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

there O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you O
're O
ordering O
in O
-- O
the O
delivery B
guys I
have O
major O
attitude O
. O

never O
have O
i O

such O
dramatic O
delivery B
guys I
( O
a O
lot O
of O
huffing O
and O
panting O
and O
muttering O
under O
breath O
b O
/ O
c O
i O
live O
in O

buttery O
, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest.. O
tasty O
at O

great O
prices O

my O
husband O
and O
i O
have O
been O
sold O
on O
this O
from O
the O
first O
visit O
. O

the O
wait B
staff I
is O
very O
courteous O
and O
accomodating O
. O

the O
space B
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O
- O
1 O
hour O
, O
but O
be O
richly O
rewarded O
when O
you O
savor O
the O
delicious O
indo-chinese B
food I
. O

there O
are O
no O

favorite O
place B
lol O

i O
love O
their O
chicken B
pasta I
cant O
remember O
the O
name O
but O
is O
sooo O
good O

its O
alright O

im O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical O
about O
this O
place B
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun O
time O
for O
low O
pirces O
. O

lobster B
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B
. O

way O
below O
average O

i O
think O
the O
pizza B
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked O
. O

had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O
. O

would O
never O
go O
back O

i O
love O
this O
place B

i O
was O
n't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
i O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
i O
had O
was O
very O
good O
. O

the O
service B
was O
quick O
and O
friendly O
. O

everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome O
. O

i O
thought O
the O
restaurant B
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

i O
ordered O
the O
vitello B
alla I
marsala I
and O
i O
was O
pretty O
impressed O
. O

the O
veal B
and O
the O
mushrooms B
were O
cooked O
perfectly O
. O

the O
potato B
balls I
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

the O
only O
downside O
... O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
ok O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O

i O
'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

very O
immature O
bartender B
, O
didnt O
know O
how O
to O
make O
specific O
drinks O
, O
service B
was O
so O
slowwwww O
, O
the O
food B
was O
not O
fresh O
or O
warm O
, O
waitresses B
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O
men O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
werent O
very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O
customers O
. O

i O
would O

this O
place B
to O
anybody O

they O
dont O
have O
. O

too O
many O
other O
good O
places O
to O
have O
to O
settle O
. O

not O
because O

i O
left O

an O

the O

consistently O
good O
, O
the O
service B
is O
pleasant O

in O
the O

the O

remember O
the O
last O
time O
i O
had O
such O
gross O
food B
in O
new O

. O

my O
quesadilla B
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three-year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O
or O
flavor O

and O

come O
on O
. O

do O
n't O
get O
me O
started O
on O
the O
margaritas B
, O
either O
. O

mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O
. O

really O
, O
i O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds O
-- O
this O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants O
, O
at O
least O
9/10 O
of O
which O
are O
way O
better O
than O
this O
one O
. O

save O
your O
money O
and O
your O
time O
and O
go O
somewhere O
else O
. O

oh O
, O
and O
i O
never O
write O

a O
weakness O

it O
's O
just O
average O
, O
just O
shredded O
, O
no O

this O
small O
astoria O
souvlaki O
spot O
makes O
what O

the O
best O
gyros B
in O
new O

. O

small O
, O
bright O
, O
and O
clean O
, O
bz O

stands O
apart O
from O
the O
usual O
run O
of O
gyro O
joints O
, O
both O
in O
astoria O
and O
out O
. O

what O
really O
makes O
it O
shine O
is O
the O
food B
, O
which O
is O
aggressively O
seasoned O
with O
cyrpriot O
spices O
, O
and O
all O
made O
in-house O
( O
even O
the O
gyro B
meat I
and O
sausages B
) O
, O
and O
made O
of O
much O
higher O
quality O
ingredients B
that O
might O
otherwise O
be O
expected O
. O

all O
the O
various O
greek B
and I
cypriot I
dishes I
are O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
gyro B
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come O
-- O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
eat O
one O
your O

the O

good O
experience O

during O
our O
trip O
to O
nyc O
, O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
four O
seasons O
for O
their O
pre-theater O
menu O
( O
offering O
a O
modified O
menu O
for O
$ O
65 O
pp O
) O
. O

the O
wine B
list I
was O
extensive O
- O
though O
the O
staff B
did O
not O
seem O
knowledgeable O
about O
wine O
pairings O
. O

the O
bread B
we O
received O
was O
horrible O
- O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
- O
and O
the O
`` O
free O
'' O
appetizer B
of I
olives I
was O
disappointing O
. O

however O
, O
our O
main B
course I
was O
wonderful O
. O

i O
had O
fish B
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
. O

the O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear B
torte I
) O
was O
good O
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

when O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

not O
what O
i O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location B
. O

all O
in O
all O
, O
i O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant B
- O
but O
i O
hope O
the O
staff B
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

short O
and O
sweet O
– O
seating B
is O
great O
: O
it O
's O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
and O
private O
. O

the O
boths B
are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they O
're O
perfect O
for O
2 O
people O
. O

the O
service B
was O
extremely O
fast O
and O
attentive O
( O
thanks O
to O
the O
service B
button I
on O
your O
table O
) O
but O
i O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B
took O
our O
order O
. O

the O
food B
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O
. O

over O
. O

over O
all O
the O
looks B
of O
the O
place O
exceeds O
the O
actual O
meals B
. O

so O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B
not O
the O
food B
. O

will O
prob O
. O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O
experience O
to O
try O
atleast O

greg B

my O
favorite O
. O

sometimes O
tables O
do O
n't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it O
's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O

who O
has O
personality O
, O
professionalism O
, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O

the O

i O
've O
been O
that O
a O

... O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
i O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

prices O
are O
fair O
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B

. O

i O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O

servers B
are O
patient O
and O
never O
rush O

force O

femme I
last O
night O
was O
a O
true O
experience O
unlike O
any O
other O
in O
new O
york O
! O

highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B
to O
the O
food B
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
i O
had O
! O

citrus I

and I
lemon I
and I
lime I
juice I
and I
mint I
leaves I
that O
is O
to O
die O
for O
! O

food B
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

we O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B
dancing I
show I
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd O
. O

i O
never O
write O
on O
these O
sites O
but O
this O
restaurant B
is O
def O
worth O
commending O
! O

great O
find O
in O
the O
west O
village O
! O

maggot O
in O
the O
food B
! O

i O
've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

the O
menu B
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

nevertheless O
, O
i O
finished O
my O
plate O
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
i O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B
sauce I
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

i O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager B
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
( O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
) O
. O

when O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
i O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
i O
did O
n't O
think O
i O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

yes O
, O
i O
ate O
the O
food O
, O
but O
i O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
i O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
i O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

the O
manager B
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

we O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O
. O

i O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B
. O

for O
a O
restaurant B
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
such O
a O
lack O
of O
intelligent O
customer B
service I
. O

a O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O
the O
haute O

, O

is O
n't O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
the O
blue O
hills O
or O
even O
the O
farm O
on O
adderlys O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
it O
's O
pretty O
good O
, O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting O
. O

unhygienic O

i O
do O
not O
recommend O
. O

i O
went O
there O
2times O

the O
atmosphere B

a O

one O

i O
've O
had O
my O
fair O
share O
of O
modern B
japanese I
and O
this O
spot O
delivers O
. O

the O
atmosphere B
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B
of I
mirrors I
. O

if O
you O
're O
into O
being O
lost O
when O
you O
're O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O
table O
then O
hey O
, O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors B
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go-to O
for O

japanese I
food I
for O
the O

future O

the O

most O
of O
the O

( O
i O
have O
to O
agree O
with O

are O
quite O
oily O

the O
chilli B
chicken I

my O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food B
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O

i O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B

i O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O

and O
the O
food B
was O
majorly O
disappointing O

rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O

offered O
, O
i O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O

rather O
than O
preparing O

the O
chef B
presented O
me O
with O
a O

any O

i O
was O
so O
stunned O

i O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O

majorly O
disappointing O

this O
place B

on O

the O

about O

they O

clearly O
over O

what O
you O

the O
environment B

the O
name O
. O

yes O
, O
the O
place B
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O

at O

i O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B
too O
expensive O
and O
i O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O

may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

i O
was O
wrong O

the B
four I

has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
new O

city O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
`` O
i O
've O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
'' O
. O

i O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
, O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
i O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
. O

all O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B
was O
great O
( O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B
) O
. O

the O
environment B
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O
. O

if O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O

yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
i O
've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

you O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B
, O
sadly O
, O
no O
. O

service B
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

terrible O
waste O
of O
money.. O
scammers O

i O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
casa B
la I
femme I
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

but O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

i O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
. O

i O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
casa B
la I
femme I
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

we O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
, O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O
! O

and O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
. O

we O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
i O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B
for O
a O
table O
. O

although O
we O
were O
told O
10-15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
. O

we O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

the O
place B
is O
beautiful O
! O

the O
hostess B
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

however O
, O
our O
$ O
14 O
drinks B
were O
were O
horrible O
! O

once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
, O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O
! O

since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
. O

our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

for O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

we O
also O
asked O
for O
hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
hooka O
. O

after O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
. O

we O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
. O

we O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

my O
chicken B
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

i O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
dinner B
. O

by O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
nor O
hooka O
! O

what O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka.. O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O

the O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O
! O

to O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

by O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
and O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food B
and O
belly O
dancers O
! O

if O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
i O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B
was O
inedible O
! O

i O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

my O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
... O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O
! O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
be O
refunded O
! O

do O
n't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
! O

i O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6:20 O
on O
a O
thursday O
evening O
. O

the O
hostess O
said O
`` O
wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
'' O
, O
to O
which O
i O
replied O
`` O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
'' O

at O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

the O
menu B
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
. O

there O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O
. O

not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B
of I
bottled I
beer I
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
brahma O
. O

the O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B
oysters I
and I
clams I
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

the O
lobster B
knuckles I
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

i O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
`` O
salt B
encrusted I
shrimp I
'' I
appetizer I
. O

after O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
( O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
) O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
brahma O
's O
- O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
. O

the O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

we O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

she O
replied O
`` O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
. O
'' O

we O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

the O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

i O
had O
the O
thai B
style I
fried I
sea I
bass I
... O
which O
was O
very O
good O
. O

everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B
mahi I
mahi I
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
grapfruit O
juice O
! O

i O
heard O
the O
lobster B
roll I
was O
excellent O
. O

they O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
( O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
) O
. O

all O
in O
all O
the O
food B
was O
good O
- O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
, O
but O
fresh O
. O

service B
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
`` O
large O
party O
'' O
! O

probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
. O

great O
indian B
food I

i O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

food B
was O
amazing O
- O
i O
love O
indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
i O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
i O
've O
had O
. O

very O
`` O
normal O
indian B
food I
'' O
, O
but O
done O
really O
well O
. O

i O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken B
tikka I
masala I
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
i O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B
. O

also O
, O
waiters B
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
, O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
$ O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
( O
more O
than O
the O
price O
) O
. O

but O
if O
you O
're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B
to O
go O
for O
indian B
food I

the O

worth O
it O
. O

we O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
. O

we O
have O
gone O
for O
dinner B
only O
a O
few O
times O
but O
the O

great O
quality O

service B
is O
given O

wretched O
and O
retching O

this O
will O
be O
only O
the O
third O
online O
review O
i O
have O
ever O
made O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
my O
life O
. O

they O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant O
. O

i O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O
food B
an O
service B
. O

for O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else O
's O
order O
. O

fine O
, O
i O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

however O
, O
once O
i O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
korean B
fair I
, O
( O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it O
's O
your O
only O
option O
) O
, O
i O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B
before O
i O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
i O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

my O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
i O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
i O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
i O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

none O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O
. O

less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
i O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O
. O

my O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
i O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O
. O

not O
only O
have O
i O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
, O
i O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
, O
i O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish O
, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
korean O
! O

we O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O
. O

it O
was O
n't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it O
's O
simply O
repulsive O
. O

eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
. O

gorgeous O
place B
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

i O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O
. O

i O
book O
a O
gorgeous O
white B
organza I
tent I
which O
included O
a O
four B
course I
prix I
fix I
menu I
which O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
lot O
. O

the O
service B
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter B
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O
! O

i O
completely O
recommend O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
visited O
dokebi O
tonight O
. O

we O
ordered O
dosut O
bibimbap O
and O
nakgi-bokum O
. O

the O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
. O

the O
bibimbap B
was O
average O
, O
but O
the O
stone B
bowl I
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
. O

too O
bad O
i O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B
bowl I
. O

the O
nakgi-bokum B
was O
horrible O
. O

easily O
the O
worst O
stir-fried B
squid I
i O
've O
ever O
tasted O
. O

the O
sauce B
tasted O
more O
like O
chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
korean O
. O

the O
side B
dishes I
were O
passable O
, O
and O
i O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
. O

the O
real O
problem O
i O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B
. O

i O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

she O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

there O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
english O
. O

as O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
, O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O
. O

my O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O

we O
were O
charged O
full O
price O

you O
ware O
looking O
for O
korean O
fusion O
, O
i O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
east O
village O
. O

authentic O
korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
32nd O

lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

we O
've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

we O
've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
. O

it O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

the O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

it O
does O
n't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

the O
farro B
salad I
and O
the O
mashed B
yukon I
potatoes I
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty O
. O

i O
love O
margherita B
pizza I
– O
i O
looove O
east B
village I
pizza I

love O
this O
place B
, O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
place O
s O
we O
always O
go O
. O

a O
quintessential O
slice B
of I
nyc I
pizza I
. O

the O
crust B
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B
is O
great O
, O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O
. O

personally O
i O
like O
the O
margherita B
pizza I
better O
, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O
. O

possibly O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurant B
in O
the O
city O

this O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B
japanese I
brasserie I
( O
that O
don O
’ O
t O
serve O
sushi O
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B
wooden I
doors I
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
décor B
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
’ O
re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

if O
you O
’ O
re O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
’ O
ll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B
booths I
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
( O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B
ceilings I
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
) O
. O

it O
’ O
s O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
‘ O
excuse O
me O
’ O
before O
the O
waiter B
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth O
! O

my O
party O
had O
the O
bbe B
$ I
29 I
fixe I
prix I
menu I
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
! O

i O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

we O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B
amuse I
bouche I
. O

our O
first O
course O
was O
tuna O
sashimi O
with O
green O
yuzu O
sauce O
. O

i O
picked O
the O
grilled B
black I
cod I
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
i O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
grilled B
salmon I
dish I
was O
better O
. O

the O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

the O
sake B
’ I
s I
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O
. O

for O
desserts O
, O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B
black I
sesame I
mousse I
( O
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
) O
and O
matcha B
( I
powdered I
green I
tea I
) I
and I
blueberry I
cheesecake I
, O
which O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
( O
i O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
philly O
– O
yes O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
) O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
, O
but O
i O
just O
can O
’ O
t O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie B
. O

i O
don O
’ O
t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
i O
’ O
ll O
come O
to O
zenkichi B
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
. O

terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
! O

the O
service B
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
. O

we O
were O
10 O
people O
celebrtating O
a O
birthday O
, O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
tent O
. O

we O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing O
! O
! O

we O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

they O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks B
adn O
their O
pita B
bread I
! O

stay O
away O

great O
shabu B
shabu I

i O
go O
here O
at O
least O
once O
every O
other O
week O
, O
particularly O
when O
it O
's O
cold O
! O

i O
love O
it O
. O

to O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
shabu O
shabu O
. O

i O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B
but O
was O
n't O
too O
impressed O
. O

but O
for O
the O
shabu B
shabu I
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
ny O
. O

in O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
i O
've O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
( O
shabu O
tatsu O
) O
and O
even O
then O
i O
prefer O
dokebi O
. O

the O
meat B
is O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B
are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B
and O
a O
salad B
free O
with O
your O
meal B
and O
service B
is O
good O
too O
. O

dokebi O
gives O
williamsburg O
the O
right O
one-two O
punch O
of O
classic O
korean B
food I
and O
fusion B
twists I
like O
pork B
belly I
tacos I
. O

the O
hot B
dogs I
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B
croquette I
sandwich I
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B
. O

restaurant O
with O
a O
view B

celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O
here O
. O

the O
food B
tasted O
very O
good O
. O

the O
family B
seafood I
entree I
was O
very O
good O
. O

the O
main B
entree I
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

we O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food B
is O
good O
, O
so O
i O
would O
come O
back O
again O
. O

this O
place B
does O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O

just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

this O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B
walls I
- O
i O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
... O

this O
place B
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

the O
concept O
of O
japanese B
tapas I
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

the O
food B
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

good O
food B

i O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
. O

the O
food B
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
, O
but O
the O
sitting B
space I
was O
too O
small O
, O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

over O
all O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
romantic O
place B
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
( O
if O
possible O
) O

loved O
it O

a O
coworker O
and O
i O
tried O
pacifico B
after O
work O
a O
few O
fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

the O
atmosphere B
was O
great O
. O

the O
food B
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
i O
would O
n't O
say O
the O
margaritas B
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

our O
waitress B
was O
n't O
mean O
, O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O
. O

i O
must O
say O
i O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

regardless O
, O
we O
'll O
be O
back O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B
. O

dumbfoundingly O
poor O

this O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

lexicographers O
take O
note O
: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

the O
servers B
at O
flatbush O
farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out O
; O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

and O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

a O
different O
server B
enhanced O
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B
( O
which O
was O
delicious O
) O
. O

overall O
the O
food B
quality O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
i O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
has O
n't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
. O

the O
place O
has O
a O
nice O
fit-out B
, O
some O
attractive O
furnishings B
and O
, O
from O
what O
i O
could O
tell O
, O
a O
reasonable O
wine B
list I
( O
i O
was O
given O
the O
food O
menu O
when O
i O
asked O
for O
the O
carte O
des O
vins O
) O

at O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive-aggressive O
torture O
. O

on O
that O
scale O
, O
it O
's O
a O
world-beater O
. O

how O
is O
this O
palce B
still O
open O
? O

i O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

my O
boyfriend O
and O
i O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
, O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
flatbush O
farms O
. O

we O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
. O

we O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
i O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B
. O

i O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B
and O
i O
was O
appalled O
. O

it O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

my O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
i O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
i O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

i O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon B
, O
and O
i O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
i O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
flatbush O
farms O
. O

at O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
i O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
i O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
walked O
away O
. O

so O
, O
i O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
i O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach O
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
i O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

i O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

i O
've O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
bbqs O
! O
! O
! O
! O

so O
i O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
. O

guess O
what O
, O
i O
waited O
for O
twenty O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
`` O
oh O
well O
, O
i O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
'' O
no O
apology O
, O
nothing O
. O

after O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
, O
walked O
away O
, O
came O
back O
another O
twenty O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
chicken O
on O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

no O
desert O
menu O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

i O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode O
, O
but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager O
. O

this O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad O
: O
the O
manager B
said O
, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
and O
i O
can O
not O
comp O
it O
. O

again O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
no O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
i O
can O
get O
you O
, O
no O
can O
i O
get O
you O
a O
drink O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O

we O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

the O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O

walked O
out O

of O
positives O
: O
cool O

good O
pita B

and O

that O
was O
actually O
pretty O
tasty O

moving O

if O
i O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
i O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B
. O

casa O
la O
femme O
is O
to O
middle O
eastern O
dining O
what O
chuckie O
cheeze O
is O
to O
italian O
. O

the O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

well O
... O
they O
can O
run O
but O
they O
ca O
n't O
hide O
. O

i O
live O
in O
the O
west O
village O
and O
i O
've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it O
's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

however O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

this O
place B
... O
god O
where O
do O
i O
begin O
. O

it O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B
i O
'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

the O
decor B
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
wo O
n't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant B
that O
took O
2 O
frickin O
hours O
to O
come O
! O
! O
! O
! O

how O
this O
place B
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
, O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
is O
beyond O
me O
. O

great O
hot B
dogs I
! O

i O
've O
made O
the O
trip O
out O
here O
a O
few O
times O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
lives O
nearby O
( O
i O
live O
on O
uws O
) O
. O

though O
it O
's O
been O
crowded O
most O
times O
i O
've O
gone O
here O
, O
bark B
always O
delivers O
on O
their O
food B
. O

the O
hot B
dogs I
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they O
're O
slamwich B
is O
amazing O
! O

going O
to O
bark B
is O
always O
worth O
the O
train O
ride O
, O
and O
will O
make O
your O
tongue O
and O
belly O
very O
happy O
! O

only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing O
-- O
i O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B
. O

but O
nonetheless O
-- O
great O
spot B
, O
great O
food B
. O

fabulous O
food B
- O
if O
the O
front B
of I
house I
staff I
do O
n't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

we O
live O
nearby O
bfc O
. O

it O
's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
, O
but O
we O
've O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

each O
time O
we O
've O
been O
, O
the O
front B
of I
house I
staff I
( O
not O
the O
waiters B
- O
they O
're O
fantastic O
- O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
) O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B
dishes I
i O
would O
never O
return O
. O

as O
bfc B
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B
of I
house I
staff I
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
! O

the O
frizzy O
retro O
girl B
( O
with O
winged O
/ O
dame O
edna O
glasses O
) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

i O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
friday O
night O
because O
she O
`` O
had O
a O
bbq O
to O
go O
to O
'' O
that O
night O
- O
wtf O
? O
? O

i O
'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff B
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
! O

there O
's O
another O
girl B
who O
i O
ca O
n't O
describe O
, O
she O
is O
about O
5'6 O
'' O
with O
brown O
hair O
, O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
*really* O
talking O
about O
. O

i O
'm O
a O
friendly O
person O
, O
so O
i O
would O
n't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
. O

again O
, O
i O
'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee O
. O

considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
i O
expect O
better O
service B
. O

so O
, O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
... O

maitre-d- B
'' O
eat O
and O
get O
out O
'' O

my O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O
. O

the O
food B
and O
service B
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre-d B
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

while O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high-end O
bottle B
of I
wine I
, O
our O
son O
's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
. O

this O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
i O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
paris O
, O
that O
i O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

his O
response O
was O
smug O
, O
arrogant O
, O
and O
condescending O
, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O
. O

a O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
: O
you O
ca O
n't O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre-d B
's O
sense O
of O
`` O
table O
turnover O
'' O
, O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is O
, O
or O
else O
. O

if O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off-night O
. O

best O
meal B
in O
a O
long O
time O
! O

mussles B
and O
calamari B
were O
superb O
saturday O
evening O
. O

i O
had O
the O
lamb B
special I
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

my O
father O
had O
the O
flank B
steak I
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

the B
four I
seasons I
restaurant I
is O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

the O
food B
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B
is O
even O
better O
. O

everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O
least O
once O
. O

highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

taking O
hot B
dogs I
to O
the O
next O
level O

at O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint O
, O
but O
at O
bark B
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B
dog I
. O

here O
the O
hot B
dog I
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

great O
atmosphere B

went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B
tacos I
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
. O

cool O
atmosphere B
, O
the O
fire B
place I
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

poor O
service B
and O
management B

don O
’ O
t O
go O
to O
this O
place B
! O

had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
casa B
la I
femme I
on O
a O
saturday O
dinner O
. O

appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

when O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
( O
another O
45mins O
) O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

the O
manager B
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
. O

when O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

on O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

can O
’ O
t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
nyc O
restaurant B
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
. O

what O
a O
hassle O
! O

the O
food B
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
outstanding O
. O

there O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B
or O
the O
wait B
for O
a O
table O
. O

on O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

mistakes O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
... O
but O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
al O
di O
la O
staff B
. O

without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
i O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
. O

expensive O

i O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

wow O
. O

the O
bread B
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

the O
pasta B
was O
well O
cooked O
, O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

i O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
i O
prefer O
bella O
via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O
. O

so O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

i O
went O
with O
jwils O
. O

her O
review O
is O
above O
. O

i O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

my O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

the O
hostess B
was O
rude O
and O
i O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B
disappeared O
. O

i O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B
looked O
at O
my O
like O
i O
was O
insane O
. O

i O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B
said O
, O
`` O
can O
i O
help O
you O
'' O
and O
`` O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
'' O

what O
? O

the O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
. O

we O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
i O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B
and O
non-existent O
customer B
service I
. O

bad O
staff B

i O
generally O
like O
this O
place B
. O

the O
food B
is O
good O
. O

the O
design O
of O
the O
space B
is O
good O
. O

but O
the O
service B
is O
horrid O
! O

i O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress B
and O
a O
waiter B
. O

the O
waiter B
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

the O
waitress B
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
( O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
, O
so O
i O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
) O
. O

i O
could O
n't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
, O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
. O

she O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
like O
this O
place B
more O
, O
and O
i O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B
. O
